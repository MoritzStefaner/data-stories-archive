You see a Dataviz somebody shares on Twitter, and there seems to be almost always a blog post that goes along with it, like how I did this what tools I used, and I think it's been really great because it started a lot of great conversations around Dataviz. And I started my podcast in 2018, and it's been a great way for me to learn from other people as well. And I think it's been a really, almost like a democratization of Dataviz opinions.

Like, people seem to get a little bit tired of Twitter and these sharp, you know, tweet lengthen critiques, and, I don't know, people sort of got tired of that and said, let's just be a little bit nicer. And so the field is evolving in different ways, and maybe we've evolved where we were. The field was kind of a little nasty in some ways, or maybe not nasty, but snarky. Right. And the snark seems to have declined, but maybe we've gone sort of too far the other way where there's not enough criticism and maybe there's not enough places to have constructive feedback and critique. I think people are also just, you know, in general, are apprehensive to put out stuff that they're not done with. Which I, which I totally get right to put out a draft of something. But I think, like Moritz, for example, you used to put up stuff all the time. That was like, this was my thought process. Here are all the visualizations I made. You did this, I remember a few years ago, I still share this with people. You did this chord diagram on muesli. Right, for this German startup, and you had, like, all the iterations that you went through. Like, why did I end up in this, in this, in this final version?

And I think that's actually quite harmful. And by now, I'm really, really opposed to just quickly dismissing somebody else's word work in a few, like, characters. And when I'm. I try, when I write about something in a critical way, I try to frame it now more as a question, like, in terms of why did they go with that? Or why did you go with that? You know, was there a specific reason? Because I might not be aware of the idea that went behind it. And often I get much more interesting feedback from everybody if I put it out as a question. So I think that's, that's something. Even if you don't agree with something, just try and phrase it, like, more as a question than a dismissive statement. But I do agree that, that there's not enough place for in depth criticism, like real, like, as you would talk about a really good musical album or a really good movie, you know, where you would, like, sort of weigh the pros and cons and talk about the cultural context or something.

So when you're asking for advice, someone would have to, you know, give it a shot and not just critique, you know, they would actually have to try their own hand at it.

Is there a study that would show me this or is there backup for that? So figuring out what are the ways that we can take all the great research that's being done and make that accessible for people to be using in their everyday visualizations.",

So when I was thinking back, one thing that stood out to me this year is that I feel people are much more sort of self aware in terms of what data can do at all or how flawed and how biased and how problematic data is. Many cases, and I think that's great. I think we had a fair share probably, of banging that drum. I'm almost thinking maybe by now everybody's so aware of the limitations that people have problems just putting out like a quick database because they are thinking like, ah, does it really show this the right thing? Or can I, can I put it like that? Or would I now need to add a lot of, like, remarks and asterisks. So my feeling is almost some people might be too self aware by now and not just quickly do a visualization of all meteor strikes or something like this, which in the past led to really cool, at least visuals, even though the data was flawed. So I think it's an interesting, interesting trend. But in general, of course, a very important one that we now understand just a publishing dataset and b, just visualizing it is not by any means direct way to truth and can even lead to untruths in some points, some cases.",

There's just a lot of tweets. And so that's the widest part of the swarm. And then it eventually sort of disappears. And as you go further and further down the page, you get further, you know, fewer and fewer tweets and sorts of sort of tails off a little bit.

Big project for me personally, I think for many others, was the simulated dendrochronology of us immigration. I call it the immigration Tree Rings project because that's how I always remember it. And it's a beautiful project, and it has a really strong visual metaphor. So the idea is to visualize the immigration into the US based on particles and depending on from which direction people came, they sort of stick to this tree trunk, and at the end it looks like a cross section through a tree. And it's this beautiful metaphor for immigration. So it's one of these cases where visual metaphor and design and overall topic come together so beautifully.

At the same time, I think maybe the phase of where the biggest innovation in Datavis comes from journalism, maybe it was like that in the past few years. Maybe that's going to change in the future. My feeling is a lot of interesting innovation will come maybe from technology, thinking about VR AR, new display techniques, things like this, or maybe generally user interface design, UX design, when we think more in the tools direction. So that's something maybe for later we discuss future trends. I could imagine that data journalism as the innovation powerhouse of data visualization might hand that over now.

And so it'll be interesting to see over the next year whether those groups take advantage of those tools and are able to create even better visualizations, because there are certainly people in those places that can do great work. They're probably managing 900 different tasks at the same time, and with better tools that are easier to use that maybe they'll be able to spend more time on the creating creative content.

Yeah, so I think from my side, I'm really happy to, I really enjoyed seeing Altair taking shape. Right. So that's basically the evolution of, what is that Vega then? Vega Litega light and all the ecosystem. I think Altair is a version of Vega Lite for Python. And I think one of the reason why this is exciting is because since this, since Python is basically one of the main, or the main language for data scientists, I can see how this is going to lead data scientists to adopt many more, more of the visualizations that we create and also introduce some interactions. So I think a very interesting aspect of Altair is that it's based on the grammar of graphics, but it's also an extension of the grammar of graphics to interaction. So I expect to see many more interactive graphics coming from the data science area. So I think that's really, really exciting. But yeah, there were a few more tools out there. Right. So for instance, I don't know, what is that, DacGl and Kepler GL from Uber? I think that was one of the major developments as well. Right, Moritz?",

Where the core diagram might be great for a food company, but the matrix might be the right representation for an academic paper. It seems a little bit more seamless and a little bit more.

That's really, really exciting. And so maybe I can briefly touch upon academic developments, even if we have done that in our review of this conference. But I think so a few major trends that I've noticed there, I think we are going towards a little bit more automation. People are exploring, trying to figure out what are clever ways to introduce more automation visualization without making it crazy. Right. So more automation in a way that it's helping you rather than hindering you or forcing you to go in a specific direction. So there are some, some of these developments, and I'm always a little cautious because it can very easily go a wire where they pretend to give you, like, you push one button and there's a solution, right. That's never gonna work. But when I talk about automation, if you think about how Tableau works, for instance, there is a little bit of automation there because it tries to infer what is the best graph for the fields that you selected, right. And it gives you a first, best approximation, and then you can change it. And I think there are people in the academic world who are exploring this idea further, I think especially from the IdL lab and Jeff Herr's group, but he's not the only one who's doing that. So I think that's interesting, and I think it's definitely worth exploring. I think another trend that I find really, really exciting. I have seen more and more people from the area of cognitive science and perception science to do a lot of work in the academic world. So I think this conference used to be mostly people from computer science, right, and a few geographers, and now we see more and more people from cognitive science. And I think that's a really good development. We need their help. We need to understand better how humans think with data and visualization. There are lots of open issues there, and I think that's great. Right? And so there are people like Stephen Franconeri, who I mentioned earlier, Steve Haroz. They are both very, very active on Twitter. That's great, right? And other people like Karen Schloss, we had her on the show. She's an expert on color lace Padilla, she's doing, she published a couple of really, really interesting papers on visualization and decision making and mental models. And there are even more people. Right. They also have a group that is called, I think, vis for vision or something like that. And it's really exciting. I hope we're gonna see more and more of interesting developments in this direction. And finally, I think another trend is, of course, the intersection of AI and visualization, and this idea of using visualization as a way to understand better how AI systems works. There is this old space of explainable AI that intersects with visualization, and there's no way maybe AI and machine learning and deep learning is not going to have an impact on visualization technologies, for better or worse. Right? We don't know, but this is already happening. And I'm pretty sure we're going to see more of these kind of developments in the future.",

I think the other thing is, of course, a lot of the projects where we might now be booked as data visualization experts to help could also be maybe next year people book an AI expert, say we can skip the data visualization part. I don't think it's a wise idea, but I think it's gonna, might be sign of the times, even though, and in many ways I think a good corporate data visualization project might in the next step lead to better automation. In many cases, because you have a better grasp on the data, you have a better understanding of the patterns in the data, and you might be able to identify a rule or a statistical correlation you hadn't seen before and build that into an automated system.

Maintaining tapestry is sort of up in the air. So we need more conferences. But I just, I want to also say, like, there's a ton of meetup groups and Tableau user groups and Dataviz meetup groups, and every once in a while, there's a gem that shows up on YouTube somewhere of someone giving a really good talk. And maybe that's the hole that needs to be filled in 2019, especially where some of those local user groups, the content needs to be. I mean, it's hard to do.

And one presentation that stood out to me was with Tyler Morgan Wall. He's local to DC and he created this package in our stats this year called Rayshader that lets you easily create a hill shaded map just with elevation data. And there was just audible gasps from the crowd seeing these almost like 3d maps. But it's bringing up this big thing on Twitter and elsewhere for him about should he even be creating this? Because, you know, 3d is bad. And his talk, he was like, 3d is not bad. It just depends when you don't have a third dimension, don't do 3d. But a lot of times it aids in your understanding a lot.

So it has become this sort of staple in data visualization. But, for instance, what you can learn from the book is that it's not really representative of the rest of his work, and he just did it towards the end of his life, basically. And really just more as a little fun exercise. And it doesn't have the rigor and the annotation that all his other works have. So it's actually quite untypical, which is interesting. And yeah, it's an amazing book. So definitely take a look. And what we mentioned already is the data feminism book, which I'm really psyched about, too, which really is a great survey of this whole idea of data feminism and what it's connected to, ideas of power and objectivity and whatnot.

So it's Jessica Hullman, Danyel Zafir and Robert Kosara. We've been talking for a long time about how do we make make research more accessible to people who just don't have time to go to see through papers or they just don't feel like because it's honestly boring. It's not just boring, it's even hard to find papers. It's not clear where to look for something. And so we thought maybe a blog could be helpful there. So we started this experiment. So multiple views tries to so we are actually not the main writers behind the blog. The idea is that we act as editors and we encourage people from the academic community to write blog posts on specific topics they are interested in. Right. So this can go from just explaining the content of a recent paper that they published as well as, I don't know, talking about the state of the art of on a specific topic as well as anything that is much more general but is rooted, grounded on research. Right. And we had a few blog posts out already and I personally really enjoyed reading them.",

I think everybody this year was drooling over all these crazy graphics that he collected there and at the same time. So in a way it's fun. It's like this curiosity show off the insane world of very specific graphic forms. But at the same time he also demonstrates, I think, that sometimes are very to a purpose crafted visual forum can deliver something no other forum can give. And so it also plays into this design and crafting real advanced, also complex data experiences, which is actually like a really serious trend.

They're all, they're geared towards the research, nonprofit sector of how do you leverage all these new technologies and tools so you don't have to rely necessarily, if you want to use social media data, for example, or you want to try to use machine learning. How would you do that? And so we have our various communications and technology and research teams writing blog posts.

Like, you know, have you thought about this, or did you think about that? And then a lot of times people will iterate. But then it also creates this really fun archive of, you know, if you want to go see 188 annotated line graphs, you can go and browse through the archives and see just a lot of visuals and try to figure out where do some things work. What might I want to emulate from other people's designs, and where do they not? What do I want to avoid? So it's been really fun.

Like, can I go to look at that? So Severino, Ribecca, who runs the Dataviz catalog, and I created the first couple things. And then we created a game. And the game, we just wanted to create something fun. And so the game was fun, but where it really sort of, for me, crystallizes. When I brought it to my son's fourth grade class and I gave them out, we did a little tournament, and it's really fascinating to see nine and ten year olds looking at a waffle chart and a sankey diagram saying, like, okay, I get this, but what is it?

They're all the same color, but they vary in size. So that's just to mess up your brain a little bit. So the core way the game is played is everybody gets a cardinal card face up, and then you put the deck in, the remaining cards in the middle face up. And then what you do, there's one graph, there's one exact match between each card. So as an individual, you look at your card and you try to find the graph on the deck in the middle. And then you take that card, and then you continue until the deck is gone. So you look for a waffle chart, Sankey diagram, whatever. So the fourth graders were great.

We have a ton of tools that we can use or a ton of ways we can visualize. But how do we not just show the data, but actually tell a story with it and get people to understand and pay attention? Because people are just inundated by more and more dataviz. And so figuring out how do you make yours the one that people gravitate towards and pay attention to and use it to solve something?
