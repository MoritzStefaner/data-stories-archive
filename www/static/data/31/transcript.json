No, it's actually true. We are not going to change anything special. But it be nice to increase the engagement from our listeners.

I felt it was generally a little bit quieter relative to the ongoing growth of the field. Mainly, I think because we didn't have those big landmark events like we had the previous year. With the Olympics and major elections in 2013, there was nothing really of that magnitude. So maybe some of the public work that was there in the past was not so visible. But certainly the direction of travel is still very positive. I mean, the first project that I think is on most of our radars at the start of last year was the workaround the guns project. The guns murders in the US by periscopic, which was. Which. It was great project, very much self initiated in response to the. It was December, I think, wasn't the disaster. So this was a great start to the year and a trend of these, I guess what you might describe as emotional visualisation projects. And it's something that Robert's picked up in his roundup of the year as well. And it really tried to find a new way to connect with people on highly emotive subject matter. And the style, the tone of voice was very, very powerful. But the story that underlied it was this sense of shock and magnitude of all these gun murders. And it seemed to capture the. Not the imagination in a positive sense, but certainly the amount of discussion points and the amount of conversations that triggered about the patterns that the filters enabled in the tool. So it's a truly exploratory visualization. I think it should the field at its best, really.",

And when their life was extinguished, the kind of little dot that was being traced dropped the x axis, and then their projected life was continued. They'd use various kind of data sets to project people's potential life that had been stolen. And that was the focus, the stolen years. And then as the animation built up the speed, because it kind of introduces you, it kind of coaches you into looking, into learning how to look and read what's about to emerge. And this kind of buildup of lines and lines, month by month, it's kind of shocking, really, in how it runs through the twelve month period. And then when the animation is finished, you can take control, grab the mouse, and do different filters and kind of explorations, but also see that these lines are actually real people. You hover over it, you see a little pop up with a detail about that person's demographic, and it really kind of lifts it off the pages. You know, this is real people, not just stats or data points.",

And that was also interesting because it was so much more, to me, it was more emotive or maybe a bit more. Less journalistic in a sense, than it would have otherwise been. So I thought that that might have been an influence from the Periscope project. So I thought that was pretty interesting. So I'm hoping, and I'm thinking we're going to see more of that kind of thing and see more kind of opinionated pieces where you have a stronger message behind the data and not just trying to show the data like you do in journalism, but really be more upfront about what you're trying to say and also more visceral and more, you know, kind of in your face, perhaps, but I think in a good way.",

It's okay. But I mean, this, you know, it's had a great impact, and once again, that I don't think that was by any means the, the first long form digital journalism piece. I know for a fact there were other, from the Wall Street Journal before that, but once again, it had such a, such an effect until it being cascaded around social media and around the web. And it has, you know, spawned a lot of, in some respects, imitations, but also some other standout pieces that, in their own right, are fantastic pieces of this kind of long form digital journalism that, you know, really draws you in. It's the multimedia experience. You know, a lot of kind of parallax. Parallax scrolling features, embedded movies that don't even need playing. They just kick in the minute you reach that part of the screen. So that was definitely a major trend throughout 2013, and I can only see it continuing throughout this year, really. But once again, it reinforced the power and the appetite for storytelling in journalism, but also something we can learn in visualization. And I guess the other standout project around storytelling that was very much a popular piece was a YouTube video by actually quite an elusive author. I don't think anyone's really understood who created this piece, but it was about the wealth inequality, and it was just a very simple kind of video graphic. And I think the narration that goes with it added a lot of value to the storytelling factor, but it just nailed it. This is what storytelling is. I don't think anyone could ever really say a bad thing about it. It would be great for the person who created it to come out the shadows and reveal themselves.",

They had one, a story which is like a travel story from, I think, St. Petersburg to Moscow. And the.

So I'm like many other people I know, mostly the things that the New York Times does and the Guardian and the Washington Post and maybe a few others, but there are actually a lot of newspapers out there and news media out there that do a lot of interesting work. That's just harder and it's not as visible as some of the other work. So there I was in Portland over the holidays and there was a piece there in a newspaper, the Oregonian, that I actually liked. I used this image in my state of infovis posting that it's a very simple scatterplot, but it actually tells a really interesting story. And I was actually surprised to find a paper that isn't the New York Times or the Washington Post using a scatterplot on not the front page, but on one of the front pages of one of the sections. So that was quite interesting to see that. And so I think there's a lot more of that happening now that's kind of spreading from those few high profile places into lots of other places. And Andy has done a really good job also of tracking some of the people who have been moving around from the New York Times to other places or, you know, just in different ways. And there's some interesting movements going on there and I think those are also helping spread knowledge, spread pollinator skills that are floating around there.",

It doesn't feel as much of a force as it did maybe twelve months ago and filling that void for next year. And we will discuss next year shortly. There's been a few appointments for Nate Silver's new project at ESPN, which could be a new interesting place for seeing some good developments in 2014. But that's for later, of course.",

But the void he's leaving at the New York Times is being filled by people at the New York Times. They are starting off a little group, and I forget who else is in there, but I know that Amanda Cox is one of the people there. So there should be some really interesting work coming out of that once that's spun up and running. And I'm assuming they're going to be mostly, I don't know, but I'm assuming they're certainly going to be doing interesting work around the elections in the US this year, which are minor elections, but still, and I don't know what else they're up to, but it looks like an interesting group of people from that posting I saw a while ago.

No, Alberto made it up and I was copied what he made up, but, you know, like a dot to represent x number of people who live there. It's the. I mean, it's the bill ranking stuff from years ago.

The difficulty I have with some of this, particularly with maps, is that very often you end up showing the same things, because you just end up, especially for the US, you have these population centers and very little in between. And so you end up with these very cool shapes, but they're always the same. You know, the number of tweets on something, they're going to be a lot more tweets with a lot more people. End up with a similar structure as a very great. The XKC comic on that that shows like, all these different things and there, they all look the same because some percentage of people. Exactly. So I did like those maps of the age of buildings that made a lot of sense. That wasn't really pixel based, it was more shapes. There was a very good project at Viz on the nanocubes that also used essentially pixel based or kind of spinning that was roughly like that. We could zoom in and out very quickly and it would change the level of detail for the aggregation. I think aggregation in general is something that's certainly very important. And in particular, on top of maps, it's something that people have been doing for a while, but I think there's still work that can be done there in terms of how you zoom, how you maybe normalize your data in some way, that you look at maybe the number of people as a reference or income or things like that. So there's something more work that could be done there, I think. And I hope we're going to see some more of that.",

And then it kind of, for certain selected areas, it played a little audio with little birds tweeting and maybe a little child's bike running past or something very kind of quaint noises. But it was a really nice way to, once again, as you said, to make this, you know, it's not an abstract concept. It's something we can make as real as possible. But also the Washington Post did one about the there's an investigation to the number of shots fired in downtown DC, and it created an audio simulation of the sound levels at different distances from the origin of these shots. And it was amazing how many shots a fire during the course of a year in DC. But once again, it gives you much, such a concrete, crystallized way to engage with that subject matter.

That's what I've seen really be where it was used really well. So there was one, this is a bit older, but the New York Times did this thing about the times of Olympic runs, and it would show you in terms of how close together the runners were, or skiers or, I forget what it actually was. And it would show that by having little, that would give you the sense of how little time there was between them, because you hear some times, but it's very hard to actually get a sense of what that actually means in terms of how close those. Those times actually are to each other. And they're very, very close, like within fractions of a second. There's also a slightly older piece that's maybe derailing this a bit because we're talking about 2013, but there was a video that was posted, I think, two years ago or so on YouTube where somebody has a history of all the nuclear explosions in. Oh, yeah, that's going back to the first ones in. I think it starts with the bombs on Japan or even the nuclear test. Perhaps it starts with the first nuclear test in the US, but it's very interesting. And of course, it's much faster than real time because it covers 70 years or so of time in like seven minutes or so. But it gives you a sense of how much was going on during certain periods and how it was kind of speeding up as they were going towards that deadline for some non proliferation contracts. And then it kind of all quiets down. And it's really interesting to see that and also gives you a sense of scale, like you were talking about humanizing the data, just how many nuclear tests were done. It's just breathtaking how much there is. And the audio is pretty useful for that. It shows you where it is, but also because you hear the beeps for every explosion that goes off, it's very impressive. So I think that actually worked really well. I'm not so convinced by audio for other things, for actual data, but for maybe to give you a sense of scale, it can be really useful.",

And since we've been talking about storytelling, that's something that's interesting, of course, and it's my personal favorite and something I'm involved in.

So there's lots of information out there, but I'm really looking forward to actually getting it out to users and actually seeing people use it and see what they do with it, because I was actually surprised by the response we got when we demoed it first at TCC. That's the Tableau customer conference in September, because I didn't think people would really see the point right away, especially business users. I just thought that they would think, well, this would be nice for journalists, but what do I get from that? But a lot of people actually came up to me later and said this is really the best feature, and they're looking forward to it because they all do presentations, they all have, they do their analysis, but then they have to present what they've done, what they found. And so at that point, they all take screenshots or export images or export PDF's and then put them into PowerPoint.

So r, just to quickly explain this to people who might not be familiar, this is a statistical package or a language for doing statistical analysis.

And that certainly has been used quite a bit already by lots of people who are very excited about that. I'm not an r user, so I can't really say much about it, but it's certainly been a big deal. And I'm not sure that, I don't think that necessarily works on Tableau public. I don't know, actually, but story points certainly do. And story points also are meant to be not just obviously used in the desktop, but also on Tableau server, which is what you see on Tableau public.

Very playful. It also borrows a bit, I think, from Tableau in the sense that you can drag your variables around into different slots. It, for instance, fills that gap like tree visualization. I never had a good way of giving a novice some way of visualizing hierarchy. There was simply no tool like when I was teaching, let's say, design students. There was no simple tool to quickly make a dendrogram tree or something like that. And this tool, and hopefully more to come really nicely, fill that gap.

Having new tools coming up is good as well for innovation. But I'm wondering if we have had too much innovation lately, and now it's time to converge on a few very good tools. And this is what seems to happen, I think D3 Tableau and maybe even r. I think there's nothing that can compare with these three tools. Right.

And I believe I was just looking at there's a visualization project on Kickstarter that was just funded a few weeks ago that I believe is also built on top of D3 and raw. May or may not be, I'm not actually sure. I don't know. So if it's about making things usable and not having to program, but making it a lightweight web thing, then that could very well be built on top of D3, but just do a different thing. Not trying to be D3, but different, be something else that gives you a different use case and makes something easier for people who don't want to program or who just can't program. So I think that's very valuable. But I don't know if we need 100 different clones of D3 like libraries, and they're out there. I mean, there are a whole bunch of libraries for not that many, maybe for SVG, but there are lots of libraries out there for canvas rendering, and I don't know how they're different. I'm just not going to look into 100 different ones. It's just too much stuff. So having one standard for something is just a good thing.

And they are actually interesting because of the way they kind of came about because the first one was WTF Biz, which is that this Internet slang for things that you kind of hear like what the. And so this is a collection of things that are questionable and it's kind of usually come with a little quip about what might be wrong there. And then in response to that, a couple of people came together and made and put together this thumbs up this, which is kind of the opposite. It's now the positive version of that to me. Talk about things that are good. And then the third one is perhaps could be the most useful one. In a sense it's help me this, which is I've done some work. I don't know really where to go. Help me.

So I wrote a rant in the summer about how a lot of visualization books are kind of lazy because you can just put lots of very nice images in there and you leaf through them and they look great. I mean, it's almost impossible to make a crappy looking visualization book. And I read a couple books over the summer, and I was just kind of really annoyed because they were all very similar and they didn't really have enough that it didn't really tell you anything new. And they all use the same examples. And so in the fall, I think around October or so, a new book came out, and I'm gonna horribly mispronounce name. Isabel Mireles. Yeah, she wrote a book that's called design for information, or actually forget the exact title right now.",

So she uses a lot of the same examples that you've seen before or that many of us, I guess, have seen before. But she digs a lot deeper. She actually explains how things work, how they are mapped, how a tree map works, for example, by actually telling you what the different parts are or showing you variations of diagrams that show how different parts of visualization, what they actually depict. And so it gives you a lot more, a lot deeper information about what's actually going on. Rather than just talking about it, it actually dives into it. And there are a whole bunch of things that are really explained nicely in sidebars and diagrams. And I thought that was really useful. And I hope that this is actually going to be a trend going forward. Where we're going to see more of that happening and we're going to get deeper books that are actually more, that don't just kind of play on the fact that they use all these great images but actually are giving you more of the background and the depth and hopefully are going to be, you know, more helpful for people to actually understand what's going on.",

So I've been teaching on the information visualization programme at Mica in Maryland and the class there do an end of year thesis project which they develop a visualisation project and then present it. And I was over there in December for the presentations and they were fantastic. They did some brilliant work. Very, very impressed. They were all interactive, they were all exploratory.

So if you ask to the average academics who is not maybe that well aware of what is going on in visualization on the web, this person will tell you that visualization is for analysis, not that much for presentation. I think this resonates very well with some of the points that Robert raises in the past, even in some of these pieces. I think you had a piece about storytelling some time ago on computer graphics and applications, and you were exactly saying that. Right. So from the academic point of view, visualization is exploratory visualization. Right.

And we've seen that at the conferences. There was quite a bit of work on that at infovis certainly this last year, and I'm sure we're going to see more of that at Euroviz this year, infovis this year, and then going forward. So there's a lot of that work being done in academia now. And so that's good to see. And I think, and it's obviously already out there. I mean, all those people doing work at news media and, you know, there's a lot of that work already being done.

So exposing people to what is this process is going to be very beneficial, in my opinion.",

And I think a lot of future visualizations will also deal with ambient awareness and monitoring and, you know, and that's absolutely. I think that's very interesting to think about because it's exactly not findings driven or it's also not storytelling, which I also love. No, but it's. That's why I also said more of everything. But I think this field is going to grow as well. Like just be aware of all that stuff that happens around you, like all your devices, your home friends, the Internet and so on.
