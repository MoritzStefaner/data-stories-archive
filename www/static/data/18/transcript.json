Yeah, exactly, something like that. And they claim that this technique is able to measure the workload, the human workload, when they are performing some tasks. And one of the findings is that basically in terms of workload, there's no difference between bar chart and pie charts. But even more interesting than that is the fact. I think that's the most interesting thing, is that people behave differently. So some people have a higher workload with pie charts, and some other people have a higher workload with. What did I say?
