Right. And I think at the very beginning, what really surprised me is that not only practitioners don't necessarily know what is happening in academia, but even more so the opposite. Academics didn't really know exactly that there were lots of really interesting practitioners doing fantastic stuff. Right. And I think one interesting thing is that this is changing. And it clear when we went to this conference together that now academics love stuff that is done by practitioners. And at the same time I'm sure that we are producing new research that can be applied in practice by many designers. So I think that's really good. That's really, really good. I don't know if this is. I think there are a few signs that show that this is happening. I don't know if this is going to last, but I think something is happening right now that's really, really good.",

I don't know. Probably it's not happening only in this. Probably it's happening everywhere, but I can clearly see it happening in my community. It's no longer sufficient just to publish a paper in the top conference. You want to make sure that you're doing some quote unquote, kind of marketing of your research because otherwise it's not enough. Right. And some people are doing this thing very, very well. Well, especially the youngest ones. I mean, Robert has been mentioning this during our last episode for a bit, but I want to iterate this thing. Some really young researchers have been giving fantastic presentations, preparing pages on the web, posting a video, making sure that everything is available and reachable on the web.

      "text": "Yeah. Then I wanted to talk about. So, going back to books, a few days back, I posted a brief blog post on this book that I'm reading is called statistics as principled argument. And I want to briefly mention that because it also introduces something I wanted to talk about that is data literacy. That is something we, briefly, me and you also discussed briefly in Paris. And I think we should actually focus much more on these kind of problems. But let me talk about the book first. So this book has been suggested to me by Alberto Cairo. The first time I think we were at this when he mentioned this book. And for a while I was a little skeptical. Then I finally decided to buy it and read it. I didn't read it all yet. I think I'm halfway through. But it's amazing because it's basically. So this book is written by Robert Abelson in the mid nineties. Okay. And the book is not at all about numbers or formulae or anything like that. There's very few math inside, and it's mostly about the idea. So the main argument of the author is statistics, is about providing an argument. So it doesn't matter exactly how much math you use, how many numbers you use. Every single researcher who is actually commenting or doing statistics on top of data is basically providing his own or her own argument. Okay. So it's not just numbers. And I think that's really interesting and very unique because I never really read anything like that before. And I think it's a super important, important message both for people who do research and generate these numbers and the statistics, as well as for people who read these statistics. Right. I think this is especially important, more important now that we see, for instance, in data journalism is so much more common to provide arguments through data, numbers and stats. So I think it is very important for people to understand that if a story is complemented with statistics and numbers, it doesn't make necessarily the story truer. Okay. It depends on the way you present this stuff. And he makes this argument really, really well. The book is split in a few chapters. It talks a lot about rhetorics and how to use rhetorics in statistics. So if you are listening to the show and are interested in that, I really, really strongly suggest you this book, because it's very unique. I read many other books, statistics book, that focus mostly on methods, how to do this, how to do that, and. But this is not about methods. It's about how do you actually provide an argument.

And how do you verify that what you're communicating is actually what, what arrives at the audience? You know, what is the concepts that are being formed in the audience's mind by the things you do.

And again, I see much more and more the link to journalism because they have to cope with the same things. You know, they dive into these big stories about, you know, complex relationships and at the end of the day, they have to write an article that people get and that people read from beginning to end. But they make sense. Right. And. Yeah, so I see this more and more, this, this general thing. And coming back to data literacy, I think that also means if we want to improve visual literacy or data literacy, I think we need to teach people how to create data visualizations, because only once you created one, you know what the wiggle room is actually, or what the crucial decisions are or how much you can actually change things up just by choosing a different chart type or choosing a different data set or leaving out a part or merging two numbers into one.

I say internship again, but it's a residency, of course. But I don't know how art and companies relate. That's often a bit tricky.

And I think in many ways, this is sort of the big challenge right now, giving all the possibilities with the huge databases and big data and lots of dimensions, lots of measurements and so on, is to come up with these poignant, smart, concise, intriguing ideas. You know, what to do with that. And often they can have a very simple core, like, it's just these two things at the same time. And I think we need more of that.

We developed a project especially for that exhibition, and the project is called on Broadway. And what we did was collect a lot of data along Broadway because Broadway actually spans the full of Manhattan. It's like 13 miles long and loads of blocks along Broadway. And you can collect a lot of data. And we collected a couple of social media data. We worked with taxi data. We have census data looking at. And so what we investigated is a bit like what could be a portrait of the city through the lens, of course, of that street, and also, then again, through the lens of these different data layers. So in the end, we produced this interactive installation that is like a big accordion. So in the beginning, you have the full street condensed into like an accordion squeezed together. And you can zoom into individual parts and investigate. Exactly. And also see how a whole neighborhood, you know, how the different neighborhoods compare to each other in the data, but also in street view images, Instagram images. So it's a mix of qualitative and quantitative research, again, a bit like selfie City, but for a street. And so it's now on show in the New York public library as a, like, interactive installation.

      "text": "Yeah. So there's actually two products. So Qlik is the company. And then there's Qlikview that's been around for a long time. I think more than ten years, actually, maybe 20 even. So that's enterprise software for business intelligence. Quite established, powerful data engine behind it. And it's a strong analytical tool in that context. And now there's a new tool from the same company. It's called Qlik sense. And that's a very fresh development. And what I really like about it is fully oriented towards the web. So even if you download the standalone application, it's actually like a chrome, you know, that just has a skin. But it's basically a webview that is being rendered. All the charts are being rendered in SVG and it's all native web technologies. And basically what it's good for, the Qlik sense software is a bit more approachable for Qlikview. You really need to be an expert and know the scripting language and write adapters to your databases and things like this. So it only makes sense if you have a big company and you have real it people working on that. And Qlik sense is much more a product for everybody to get started and build dashboards and analyze data themselves and really quickly build interactive visualizations. It's really nice. So I was quite impressed with. So I got a demo from one of the guys, and he really, within a few minutes, build a really complex dashboard dashboard that had really good interaction possibilities. So you can zoom all the charts. You can brush data in one chart and it will be brushed in the other ones. You can immediately drill down into datasets by selecting something in one chart and then see how it plays out in the other charts. It's really nicely done. And the charts, they scale quite well. It runs on tablets, phones, because it's all web based, basically. So, yeah, it's really kind of nice. So you can try it out on click.com, comma, click with a queue. So you have to get used to that. It's Qlik. And we'll put a link to the Qlik sense, which I would really recommend into the show notes. And if you want to see what you can do with click, there's a really nice, for instance, a quantified live demo. So there was one guy who built like a Feltrand style yearly report, and he built this whole dashboard for his whole year, all the data he has collected. It's very interactive. And so because it's web based, what's really nice also is you can build your own charts and connect them to the click engine. So if, you know, for one type of data, the line chart is fine, or the bar chart, whatever. But if you have maybe a D3 component, you want to use like a network visualization, you can, there's sort of a plugin architecture, so you can just put your own visualizations inside the Qlik sense dashboards. That's super nice. And the other thing I learned because I also didn't see it much in the wild. So you might wonder why I haven't never seen, you know, the software, it's mostly used inside companies, so it's not so much, you know, on the web sharing. Cool stuff. Used a lot inside organizations and companies. And it's a really powerful tool. And, you know, this might explain why you're like, I never heard of that. But if you're not in that world, you don't see what they're doing.",

So we started analyzing and reading all these books or resources about deceptive visualization, how to live with charts, how to live with statistics, and even Tufte has a lot of this kind of information in his books.

I mean, this is this kind of research that is purely, I don't know, experimental, really not trying to do anything that has a practical application. Right. But I was really, really curious to see how that worked. So what we did basically was to create. So first we collected a certain number of deceptive visualizations and created different kind of categories of deceptive visualizations, how they deceive. And then we focused on a few ones that are very, very common. Like for instance, how is it called when the bar chart, the baseline of a bar chart or a line chart is not a zero, truncated. Yeah, truncated y axis. And so we collected a few, we isolated a few of them and then run experiments trying to see and created for each one, two versions, one that is deceptive, one that is not deceptive, and try to basically quantify how much distortion there is. When you ask a group of participants to evaluate the information that is in the chart. Right. And so surprise, surprise, the result is that they are very deceptive.",

Right. Or it's obvious numbers don't lie. Numbers tell always the truth. Numbers don't lie. Right. And of course you have also people on the opposite side of the spectrum is, I don't give a shit. I don't. I don't. I don't believe anything that is presented this. Right. All propaganda. Another interesting one that I think it's somewhat dangerous, in my opinion. There are people who actually never change their opinion, no matter how much evidence there is against their opinion. Right. And you can clearly detect these kind of people there because there are people who clearly write. I don't care. I don't care what you show me. I will never change evidence. Evidence, yeah. Oh, absolutely. Evidence is overrated. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And this reminds me of a book that Alberto has been been suggesting for a while that is called unpersuadables. I didn't read it yet, but it's on my tool to read list and sounds very much related. Right. So what is the psychological mechanism through which some people cannot be persuaded of anything? Right. So it's very interesting, but also very fascinating. Yeah, yeah, sure. I don't know.",

And this actually gives me the opportunity to mention that this work is in collaboration with two of my colleagues, and one of them, she's a professor at the NYU School of Law and she's an expert in human rights. And it's really interesting because the way this work started is because basically she came to me and said, I want to learn more about visualization. I get a sense that visualization can be used to persuade people of important problems in human rights. And especially, I mean, the kind of problems that these people have is that they know that there is a new kind of crisis. They have to convince some stakeholders to take action. And whatever you can provide, whatever new tool you can provide to them to help communicate this information better can actually make a big difference. Right.

Like playing ground and playground rules also. Then in the exploratory data or in business intelligence or in, you know, whatever we do. So it's a whole different field, and it's kind of interesting. I was sort of reminded also the complexities, you know, so we talk so much about, like, global data and how to improve the world with charts and so on. And so also over Christmas, I read up a bit on inequality, and, boy, that's so complicated. You know, in the beginning, you think, you know how it works.
