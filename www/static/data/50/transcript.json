And your podcast is helping me endure the temperature quite well because it's so engaging and so fun and so informative. And I would like you, I would like just to thank you for the work that you are doing. I believe that what you do is a great service to the visualization community or to the visualization communities, I would say, because there are several communities within visualization. Right? We have, you know, business analytics and visual. Business analytics, and we have traditional information visualization, news visualization. All of us, you know, we need to. We need to talk more to each other, I believe, and I also think that the podcast that you are doing is helping with that goal of getting people in touch and making people understand, basically, that the principles of visualization, no matter how flexible they are, etcetera, they are common to all of these industries or to all of these communities.
