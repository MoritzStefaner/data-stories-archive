It could be probably the most important skill that students learn. And today of all times, people are throwing data everywhere on their own website, in news stories, and somehow data almost looks more truthy than even sort of these rhetorical arguments, because there have been lots of courses in the humanities and philosophy that have been talking about critical reasoning and data reasoning. But the focus of this class will be sort of the ways in which data can be manipulated.",

There's actually a reasonable amount of philosophy written on what bullshit is and some argumentation about whether bullshit is in the eye of the producer or the eye of the beholder. Been a nice debate in the philosophy literature. We think about the way we're talking about calling bullshit, and so we think about the way that calling bullshit is itself a speech act. It's not a proposition, it's an active thing that you do that has a certain force. And so we talk about that and we talk about how to do that without being an asshole, which is, I think, kind of important, too.",

And we try to just instill these habits of mind where you're constantly thinking as you're reading stuff, whether it's in the New York Times or on Facebook or, you know, whatever. Is this right? Does this make sense? Is this even feasible? And getting in the habits of sort of digging deeper into things that you actually care about, digging deeper before you share something stupid, for example. And then we go on, we talk about correlation and causation, because that's a common area for bullshit, essentially. We talk about statistical traps and the kinds of things that can trip people up. We look at as we're going forward, we're going to be looking at visualization and the way that people mislead others with visualizations. We are going to talk about big data and the way that the sort of cult of big data is used to promulgate extreme bullshit.",

      "text": "Well, I mean, the other thing is we want to sort of even talk about the ethics of calling bullshit because in a lot of cultures, it's really scary for an individual, especially younger students that we talk a lot with, to call bullshit, but we want them to be able to call bullshit and also receive the calling of bullshit. So we'll talk about the ethics of calling bullshit. We'll talk about some of the ways we call it the natural ecology of bullshit. So the environments in which this kind of information falsehoods really fly faster. So we'll talk about their social media environments and talk about some of the papers that are being written by researchers in this area. But what's crazy is you would mentioned this sort of class took off when we released the course on January 11. We went to bed and that night thinking, well, I hope a couple of our friends think this is cool because we put a lot of effort into it. And we woke up and there was just tens of thousands of people from all over the world. And it's just when we registered the class, it was registered within a minute. So I think it's really resonating. And we want to take advantage of this moment where critical reasoning and data reasoning is now cool with students. So that's sort of what we're trying to take advantage of. But the other thing I wanted, since you guys are on the radio, this is a question. I'm going to flip back at you guys, because you guys know language is better than Carl and I. When we in the English language call bullshit, and calling bullshit, it carries a certain weight and there's very few synonyms that sort of, sort of, you know, mirror that particular calling. And so is there in other languages. Do you know how is it used? And I think it would be useful because you have such an international audience for this, for this show, you know, how else is there different ways in which it's used in these different languages?",

And so they use big words, they make stuff up and they just kind of babble on. And this is kind of what makes it so dangerous, according to this, or philosophers of bullshit, is that it is this indifference to the truth with a liar. You know, where that liar stands with the bullshitter. There's just, there's, there's no connection at all. And I think that kind of bullshit can be very common. It's what we train students to do. If they're running out of time and they haven't started their term paper yet, they aren't actually trying to tell you anything. They're just trying to make you think that they've read the book and know what they're talking about. And we do that a lot ourselves. I believe in normal interactions with people because we're trying to make a good impression about ourselves. We're not actually interested in the message we're sending.

You kind of broke things up into two categories. And one of the categories that you talked about was number decoration. And it was just these dashboards that essentially are providing five or six numbers, or maybe eight, but they've got all these fancy pictures and speed dials and all of this kind of stuff on it. And this strikes me as really classic bullshit, because the idea is that there's all this decoration on there, and none of it is serving to actually convey any extra information. All it's doing is making you think, wow, that designer is really good. She's got a wonderful eye for color, and she can really use that program or whatever it is, which is bullshit. It's communicating about the communicator in the guise of communicating information. And I thought that was really interesting.",

Are there any tips on how you can detect bullshit? Like, sure. I feel there's like, at some point you develop a certain sense of, ah, this might be bullshit, even if you know nothing about the domain. Really?

      "text": "Definitely. We've done some introspection, trying to think about what is it that we're actually doing when we sense that something is bullshit. And one of the most important ones is just to look at a claim. And if it seems too good or too bad to be true, it probably is. Even if the claim supports whatever side you like, supports whatever beliefs you have, if the effect size is really big, maybe implausibly big, it's probably bullshit, and you need to look into what's going on there. So that's one of the things we're really teaching our students to think about, is always question that and be really well aware of confirmation bias. The idea that if somebody comes and says, wow, something I don't believe is really true, then I'll say bullshit. But if someone says, oh, this thing I believe is true, then I'm likely to just say, oh, yeah, sure, that's got to be right. And so checking out all of those kinds of things I think is super important. One of the things we're really stressing in the class is that because since we're thinking about the way people bullshit with facts and figures and algorithms and statistical analyses, is that you don't have to necessarily understand the statistical analysis at the heart of a claim. If you just think carefully about what you think of the statistical analysis as a black box and you think carefully about, well, what are the data that go in? Are those reasonable? Are they selected in a fair way? Are they even capable of supporting the kind of claims that are going to be made? And then you look at what comes out, you say, is this reasonable? Is it the right order of magnitude? Is it fairly presented? And so we really think that we can teach people to call bullshit without having to unpack the big data algorithm that's being used or whatever it is in the center to kind of drive things through.",

So if you ask a lot of people, you say, so what's the mean income in the United States that tells a much different story than something that is closer to the median. And so it's these kinds of things, it's sort of teaching them really, I mean, because we really want wide reach with this content at first, and then we'll probably splinter into more, maybe more sophisticated material that we can get a lot by just teaching people to do what Carl said question when it sounds too good to be true, that's probably one of the biggest ones. The other things in spotting bullshit is just asking about where the source is coming from, who is telling me this, why are they telling me this?

I mean, I think this, one of the things we're going to talk about a lot in the class is this issue of publication bias and how bullshit comes perhaps unintentionally into science. And that may be bullshit more largely construed rather than this kind of narrow definition we were talking about before. But teaching people how to be skeptical of things even that they see in the published literature, even in a really good journal, just by understanding the fact that you can't publish something unless you get a positive result. And so if there's something a lot of people were working on, and it's not actually true, then, and you'll still see those false positives coming up in the literature, and you won't necessarily see the negatives because it's very hard to get those published. And then that can give you this really, really confusing picture. There was a remarkable study in the New England Journal of Medicine, I believe, that was done about ten years ago, where somebody at the FDA looked at all of the clinical trials of antidepressants. And so if you look at the published literature, you see that there's almost all of the clinical trials of antidepressants were successful. But if you look at what had actually been registered with the FDA, more than half of the trials had been unsuccessful. And some of the ones that were reported as successful were just reported as successful by manipulating the desired outcomes that they were measuring and things like this. And so if you had the whole picture that the FDA had, you get a very, very different story. At least half of these things aren't working than the one that was in the published literature that scientists had access to. So I think this kind of thing is quite common. It's just usually we don't have that information in the background, so we don't know the FDA knows, and we could look at that. Usually, we don't know what people have sitting in their desk drawers. It's called the desk drawer effect. Right.",

So this is this situation where there were some false news stories about a restaurant in Washington, DC, housing a child, you know, sex ring that was being run by, you know, Hillary Clinton. Of course, this was complete false. And even. Even those that had. Were promulgating this were saying, okay, later on they said, okay, it was false. It's not true that there was a young man from the Carolinas, came with a gun and came, guns ablazing into this restaurant. Well, he found it wasn't true. And he, of course, felt bad. He was trying to do what was. He was trying to save some kids. Well, the worst part, the worst part is that not too long ago, a couple of weeks after this had been even refuted by those that were pushing this falsehood, there were protests outside the White House with t shirts saying, pizzagate is real. This is a conspiracy to cover this up. People still believe this. So this goes along with the Brandolini asymmetry principle, which is that bullshit. Once it gets out there, once falsehoods get out there, it's really hard to clean up the system. So, you know, once falsehood flies, the truth comes limping after sort of thing. So this is. This is an example that we really, you know, these are. These kinds of examples are real. These are affecting people's lives. It's sort of life or death. We even see tweets from, you know, these saber rattling tweets from the, like, pakistani Israeii defense or the pakistani defense minister tweeting back to Israel saying, you know, don't forget we have nukes, too, because they were responding to a fake news article.

And so what the idea is, you say, okay, if I follow from the same premises you're using to get your result, then these ridiculous results also follow. And one of my favorite examples, there was a paper that was published, I think, kind of as a joke, but no one's admitted that. It was a joke in nature about a little over ten years ago, where a group of statisticians did linear regressions on the hundred meter dash times of men and women. And so the 100 meters dash times of women were getting better faster than the 100 meters dash times of men. And so the conclusion of the nature paper was that based on these linear regressions, the women would start running faster than men around 21 62. And so a bunch of people wrote in to try to debunk this. There's a beautiful letter from a Texas high school statistics class that explains what's wrong with this. But my favorite response is reductio, where somebody says, well, you know, that's really cool. It's really interesting to see that. But you've missed the really exciting thing because your model predicts that there's going to be a really fantastic race in around 26 50 when people will actually record negative times in the 100 meters.",

And also there has to be some sort of respect and civility in a room where there's going to be people with divergent or lots of different backgrounds and expertise. And so there needs to be a respect for that kind of expertise. One of the things that we're, again, being very careful about, because we do attack things in science, we don't want students to feel have their grounding completely shaken with saying that nothing out there is true. It's all bullshit. So we're sort of doing that balance act. So I think that goes along with the ethics of refutation, too, that you have to have some grounding in what's true. And philosophers for centuries have been talking about this problem. When you can't reconcile on a third party, if you can't reconcile on a third party. And right now we can't, at least in the US, we can't really reconcile even on media anymore. The only thing you can do is dialogue. So create.
