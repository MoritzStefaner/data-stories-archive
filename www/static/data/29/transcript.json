      "text": "Well, thank you for the opportunity. My background is in computer science, doing database and file design and optimization techniques, very traditional computer science. And I began to be interested more in the psychological issues and studied the way programmers worked and then began to study how users of interfaces do their work. So my book in 1980, imagine, was called software psychology, that talked about these things and that was a big success. So that encouraged me and began to become 20% of an experimental psychologist in studying the way people use computers. And that led me more and more towards the visual aspect, which was in harmony with my interests in photography. My uncle was a famous photographer named David Seymour. So that was my potential potential alternate career. But I chose to keep it my hobby. And many of you know that I'm always taking pictures at conferences of professionals, but I made that a hobby, and my work became computer science, and that worked out very well. And over the years, I became more and more interested in combining these interests, making visual interfaces and representing information in visual formats. So I would say for me, the important step was 1980, 119 82, when I composed the theory of direct manipulation, the visual representation of the objects of interest, and the rapid, incremental and reversible operations that users could apply, and then they could immediately see the results of their work. And so that influenced the development of graphic user interfaces and video games and many other systems. There are many other people who had such ideas, but I think people appreciated that. I wrote down the psychological foundations and gave some principles for the design that they could teach to others and apply in their own work. So by the late eighties, I was already making visualizations. And the story we have today is of a particular challenge of tree maps, which began in 1990. So I was running our laboratory. The human Computer Interaction laboratory at the University of Maryland began in 1983. And we had a nice group that was working on doing empirical studies. And there were 14 people who were sharing a single hard drive on a Macintosh. Imagine that. And so I was always in trouble because the hard drive would full up, be filled, and I would have to run around to figure out who to bother to free up some space. And as you know, you click apple I and you get to see a textual list of the number of bytes in each directory. But I wanted more than that. And so I had to do that 14 times to understand who was using the space. But I also wanted a recursive program which would go not just to the first level, but would go deeper and deeper. I and I worked on that for months. And finally one day, I had this great aha. Moment of discovery of. And it took me three days to convince myself that it was the right idea. And so that's where the original notion of the visual representation of a hierarchy came from. That would show on the screen, on one screen, without scrolling, an entire hard drive in a color coded, size coded manner that was recursive and would go down for as many layers as necessary. So that was a great fun. And Brian Johnson was a PhD student who made the first implementation on Macintosh. And so we began to tell the story. And I believed I that within a few years, this would be on everybody's hard drive.",

      "text": "But as you know, I think it's interesting and just come across the issue that new ideas are slow to be accepted. It takes a lot of improvements, adaptations, it takes a lot of effort till people learn about these ideas, until they also change their process of problem solving. I think that's the central feature, how to shift the approaches of solving problems from textual ones, from numeric, from tabular, towards a visual approach. And so I've come to realize that will take not just ten or 20 or 30 years, but it will take 51 hundred years to make such changes. And I think if we see how cartesian coordinates from Rene Descartes took hundreds of years to gain widespread acceptance, and the works of William Playfair in the 18th century took more than 100 years till they gained acceptance. I think we have the great power of computers now, which are such wonderful visual tools that enable us to try things that are new, to catch people's attention. And then, of course, we have the Internet that helps us disseminate ideas in a way that is potentially more rapid than ever before. So that's, I think, the interesting framework of it. But the tree map idea was a simple concept to show an entire hierarchy, whether it's a thousand nodes or a million nodes, to see it all on one screen at once with no scrolling. So that was the challenge, and it was satisfying to find one solution, which we called the slice and dice method. And so we were quite excited about that and began to find many applications in other areas. Sports data, financial data, that is, portfolio, stock market portfolios are nicely represented by treemapse. And so we began to find a variety of applications for this idea. And after a few years, as is our style, we gave up on tree maps. We said, okay, we did our work, we published our papers, and we're finished. And so we put it aside, we move on to other topics. But by 19 98, 99, suddenly there was a great growth of interest because of two things. Jarke van Wijk in Netherlands developed the squarified algorithm for tree maps, which were a very nice improvement. And Martin Wattenberg developed what I call the cluster tree map. And both of these had the advantage of using more square like aspect ratios to show the regions. And that turned out to be a really important improvement. What was amazing to me was I was very devoted towards the treemap layout algorithm, the slice and dice algorithm, keeping the data in alphabetical order or some numeric order. And I couldn't give up that constraint. So I never even thought about the idea. And they both changed the game by realizing that square like aspect ratios were very important for visual appeal and for organizing the information, but they gave up the orderliness of the slice and dice algorithm. So I got involved with Martin Wattenberg, who's a brilliant programmer and a great designer, and helped with his work@smartmoney.com to make the market map, which became maybe the widely, the most widely known implementation of tree maps and certainly helped a great deal in disseminating to many people. So finding a good application that many people are interested in, like the stock market, turned out to be very important. And he used the area of each rectangle to indicate the market capitalization, that is, the value of the company, and then the color would indicate whether the stock was rising or falling. So green stocks were rising and red stocks were falling, and that made great sense to people. And in one screen, you could see about 600 stocks, and you could immediately see which of the eleven sectors was doing well, energy, or telecommunications or software, or capital goods, etcetera, or health. You could see which sectors were more green or more red. And so that was a very important application, and it gained widespread popularity. So we came back into the treemap game, and I was determined to find another algorithm which would still give you good square like aspect ratios, but would preserve ordering. Yeah, the order. So that became the next generation of treemap algorithms. And that was done with some wonderful partners, with Martin Wattenberg and Ben Bederson, both amazing, terrific programmers, designers. And that is maybe one of my most satisfying papers that was published in 1992 in the ACM transactions on graphics, it had everything. It had design ideas, it had usability studies, it had algorithms and optimization of algorithms. So there was something in it for everybody, and it helped raise attention. So that's a good start on the early history. Let me pause and see if you have any questions about that.",

      "text": "Well, I think that's really a good topic for discussion. And I'm just one voice of many, so you'll have different opinions. But I told you already about my background, which involved the concern for photography and visual composition, at least, and visual design. And also all during the sixties, when I was a student in New York, I was a frequent visitor at the Museum of Modern Art. And so the exhibits of the op art and the pop art and the experiments in art and technology and Nam June Paik and so many other advanced thinkers were very influential to me. Also, the 20th century modernist and later abstract expressionist artists were important to me. And of course, as we'll see, personalities such as Mondrian were clearly using geometric shapes, and Mark Rothko and Paul Klee and Hans Hoffmande, Joseph Albers homage to the square was a wonderful exploration of color and shape. And so I was fascinated by all those ideas. It's maybe worth mentioning that one of my earlier contributions, let's say, in 1972 and 73, was what we called structured flowcharts, and eventually they became known as Nassi Shneiderman diagrams. So here was another one of those aha moments. I was attending a talk about software engineering when I was a graduate student, and the argument was that the old flowcharts were no longer useful, that we had to think in terms of structured programming, if then else and do while. And so it struck me that the go to and the arrows in flow charts were not a good idea. And so in 15 minutes, I drew the basic ideas of how to have nested rectangles to show and other shapes to show the if then else structure, the do while, and the recursive nature of programs that were being written in these new languages. And so I came back to Stony Brook, where I was a graduate student, and my colleague was Ike Nassi, and together he was studying more of this directly in his dissertation work. I was still working on database things, so he helped formulate these ideas in a more organized way. And we submitted this paper. Here's another great story, and it's on the website, on my website. So we submitted this paper to the communication of the ACM, and it was rejected in a few weeks, very quickly, with the message that the authors should collect all copies of this paper and burn them. And I have never gotten such a strong rejection as that. So you can see the scan of that, that rejection letter on my website. But NASA Shneiderman diagrams were also a visual representation of programs, and they became a huge success story for 30 years. And, you know, there's thousands of papers and hundreds of software implementations, dozens of patents. It's an international standard taught and used in many places. Its utility and its usage has declined with newer programming strategies and interactive development environments. But it was great fun that without doing much, this idea traveled very well. And so I had the understanding that visual representations had great power, but also they provoked strong responses, negative as well as positive. And so it was very interesting to see, during the 1990s, how the tree maps emerged, how they were accepted or not by different groups, and how they spread to different fields of work. Now, you asked me also about the times. So, you know, when we published this in 1991 and 92, there still was not an information visualization conference. That began in 1995, I believe. Yes, 1995. We then had a ready information visualization conference. By 1999, you may remember, with Stu Card and Jock Mackinlay, we wrote the book readings in information visualization. So we were beginning to help form the idea of what was this new discipline. And next year we'll be celebrating the 20th anniversary of the information Visualization conference. So by the late 1990s, some people began to see how this idea was important. Stuart Card wrote a very good set of cognitive principles as to why information visualization would be helpful. And so we began to understand and apply that in many areas. And of course, we moved on. And the idea of spot fire and the dynamic queries began in 1991. Two, three. And Christopher Ahlberg spent the summers of 1991 and 1993 working with us. And we published the paper in the CHI's conference of 1994. And that about the project we called Film Finder, which was a result of IBM funding to develop a catalog. If we had 10,000 videos, how would we enable users to explore 10,000 videos? So we developed this visual interface and by 1997, Christopher Allberg formed the company Spotfire. And I was pleased to serve on the board of directors for five years. And that was a great success story. I learned a lot about business and how ideas travel and how innovations become successes. And it grew to 200 people, which was a great success story. Pharmaceutical drug discovery was the main initial application and showed success there. And then chemical informatics, oil and gas discovery, production, manufacturing, and so on. So by 2007, that was purchased by Tibco, and that was a very satisfying story that took ten years to unfold. And so I had the chance to see close at hand how ideas travel from universities to business successes.",

      "text": "Right? So over these 20 years, I came to see that the tree maps we made sometimes, sometimes were very appealing. The colors and the shapes and the layout made for attractive ideas. And people said, oh, you should frame it and put it on your wall. And I heard that so many times that I decided, okay, let me spend the summer and try to find a way to make tree maps with real data about real problems. But let me try and use the tree map algorithm. And by now, we had five different tree map algorithms and try to make something that was aesthetically appealing. So it's an interesting question of the bridge between functional, which was entirely my motivation for treemaps, and the idea of something aesthetic, and our original treemap tool, which is still free to download for anyone who wants to try to make their own, has features in it that let us remove the technical aspects, the labels and the legends and the scales, and all the other things that are necessary for an effective visualization, and show only the color and the shapes in a way that lets the viewer focus on the aesthetic aspects. And in the Treemap art project page, I put down that there were four different aesthetic principles that could be exercised. First, the layout, which of the five algorithms to use, the slice and dice, the squarefy, the order, the strip, and so on, what colors that turns out to be the important, really strong effect, the aspect ratio of the entire image, would it be square or golden ratio, or would it be narrow and wide or tall? And then the prominence of the borders for each region and each level, and how strongly we drew those borders. And so those are the things. During the summer, we played with. And on the website of the Treemap Art Project, we show you 50 or 60 of our draft designs of the things we tried to do, and then we chose from those twelve that we really liked. And actually we did a little crowdsourcing, inviting friends and colleagues and students to vote on their favorite ones. It was very interesting because the vote did not converge on one or two being the most favorite, but they had many, many different favorites. And so we chose twelve of them. And I was pleased to work with a wonderful graduate student who had been in my course and proved to be a good designer. His name is Minhaz Kazi. And so together we worked during the summer and chose to twelve that we liked, and we polished them and cleaned them up and dealt with the colors, and then began exploring printing and various sizes and different print techniques and different printing offices. And so that was another effort that took another month until we were happy with our design and the printers we chose. And then we began to make the production versions. So we decided to make them all the same, 24 by 36 inches. And we added paragraphs of description that told about what was the data and then what we were trying to accomplish. So some of them looked like Mondrian, and we used Mondrian's color palette to highlight them. Others we had data about the state of Maryland and its grants for energy renewal. So there was solar and there was wind and four kinds, and we used the four colors of the Maryland flag to choose the color palette, and so on. We went through Hans Hoffman's work and Joseph Albers, and so we developed a range of these, which we tried many versions of, many versions of. And in the final exhibit, which you can see online. Or we did finally print them all and get them mounted and framed and hung in the hallways of computer science at the University of Maryland. And that happened at the last week of August, finally. And so they're hanging there now for almost two months. And it's very interesting to see the reaction. Of course, in the beginning, my colleagues wondered, what is this strange beast? What's going on here? What's happened to Ben Shneiderman? You know, what's he doing? And over time, though, it was very satisfying to see that it takes a while. And they began to come back to me, and they say, you know, I went to see him, and it's terrific. It's exciting. They're creative, beautiful. And they started to ask me for copies. Can I get one for my office? So we began to have a little bit of a, an interest in it, and so we prepared a special print for some of our colleagues to put in their office. So that was very nice.",

I wanted them to think about them as art and look at them for their aesthetic principles. So some people succeeded to do that. Other people told me very clearly, I'm too much of an analytic person. I want to know what every box means. I want to know what every color means. I want to know why it's there. And I understand that. And I was trying to get away from that, because for 20 years, that's what I did. And so I wanted to try something new which focused more on the art and the aesthetic components. And I should say not all my artist friends were charmed by this approach, either. Some like this, but others said, you know, it's not really art. It's still constrained by the treemap algorithm. It's constrained by the data. You didn't have the full freedom to do what you wanted. You were limited and constrained. And yes, that's true. And so it's a kind of middle ground between the expression or abstract expressionist ideas of the sixties and the technical. So some people call this data art. Okay, data art as a middle ground. There's data visualization on one side, or information visualization as a more technical goal of serving users, and there's the artistic side on the others, which is just, you know, free form artists. Sometimes there's computer art, which uses computers to create shapes and forms and colors in an algorithmic way, but it's much more focused on the art. This is kind of a middle space, and of course, middle spaces when they're new ideas, are not always comfortable for people.",

But back to the issue of constraints. Certainly, Mondrian worked with constraints. He had very clear principles about how he did his layouts. And so we see those kinds. And Joseph Albers certainly, I mean, he was very constrained. He had these homage to the square of one square within another square within another square, and he had a few variations, but it was really a very limited range of geometric shapes. But he explored the color relationships in a way that nobody else had ever done before. And so, you know, these, each of these projects were rejected by many people, but eventually gained appreciation, and I hope I will have the same satisfaction that I will have my supporters who like it. So I'm pleased that a half dozen bloggers have already mentioned and described the treemap art project. I'm pleased to do this podcast with you. And I'm happy to report to you that my initial response from the National Academy of Sciences in Washington is that they will, they will, they plan to host this exhibit starting in October 2014. So approximately a year from now. So that will raise the prominence, and that will show, give my colleagues something to think about, because they will see that somebody else appreciates this idea, and we'll get some greater visibility at that time.

Still, after 30 years now, I would say it's a success story that the CHI's conferences and the work of combining psychological methods and theories with design and implementation of advanced technologies is what makes the success. That's why 5 billion people have a cell phone or a smartphone in their pockets. We have, of course, the success of the chip designers, but also the success of the graphic designers and the user interface designers. And I think that is increasingly appreciated as a key. One of the keys to success of commercial and technological projects is that we should attend to the aesthetics. I mean, this is not a new idea, but it has its new forms. Beautiful bridges were always in beautiful buildings where, you know, for a thousand years or more were understood that a building should be not only functional, but it should be beautiful. And I think the buildings we live in, the technologies we live in, need to be functional and beautiful.",

And you have to remember that while those people who are engaged in this work see it as a success story already, we are still only a small fraction of the population, and it will take 100 years. As I said at the opening, for these ideas to spread, we need to create national educational programs of visual literacy. We have to teach people who resist the visual approaches to think visually, that we use visual reasoning strategies for analyzing big data. There's many, many places that these new ideas need to be applied. So the first moment of excitement. Well, there still is excitement, I would say. I love to go to the infovis conference. I still see many new ideas, but now there is the hard work of moving from 1% of the population to 10% of the population, and then to 50% of the population. And so I see many companies and government organizations have to work very hard to promote visualization inside their communities. Remember, we live in this small world of people who are already sympathetic to visualization, but we have to reach, our job is to reach the wider world of people who are not yet sympathetic, who don't use visualization. And so that will be an important challenge. So that's, I think, the central direction that will occupy many, many people. How do we bring visualization to high schools and junior high schools and lower schools as part of their training, so that it becomes a natural way for people to solve problems. Okay. I think there are problems, furthermore, of improving collaboration over visualizations, of integrating visualization into existing toolkits. There's just a variety of things to be done. We work a lot on the medical space, and in the may issue of IEEE computer, we have a description about how visualization can help in medicine, both for personal health, for clinical treatments, and for public health users. And we lay out seven challenges of what needs to be done for, for us to achieve the full success of using visuals, visual reasoning strategies to make healthier lives. I think that's our challenge.",
