So you need to do something good, so you need to do a good podcast, you need to be very good at writing, you need to do great data visualizations, but this also needs to be reflected from the society. So there's some kind of component that needs to reflect that if you're like an amazing writer but nobody knows about this and you're not really successful. So it's these two components and how do they play together to create this kind of success? And yeah, the tennis project is the first time that we actually looked at success in sport. And it started I think like two years before I came. So it's a very long project. It's going on since like three years. And when I came in, they already had had the data and had the analysis.

So this model is predicting Wikipedia page views based on your performance data. So she used different measurements of performance to predict how many page views you're going to have tomorrow.

The famous map physician John Snow, created to show the root cause of a cholera outbreak was coming actually from an infected pump. And also the splendid work of Florence Nightingale, such as her Costco visualization showing causes of mortality in the army in the east.

The data was, like, huge and very dense. And then I was like, okay, let's do a 3d version of this. And we plotted it and looked at it, and it was like, wow, okay, this is very nice. There's, like, so much structure in there. And from there on, we did a lot of refinements and changed the interface. But it's very simple. It's like the tennis stuff has all these multiple layers and these things you can click through. And in the universe visualization, you have this one cube where you have galaxies, and you've got different models how to create models out of this, to connect these galaxies to one another. But it's very simple. You've got, like, one filter that you can use, and that was interesting for the scientists, but it's rather a very simple interface in that sense. So it was very different.",

It was about showing this connections. And the color, like, took so much away, away from this, from the actual insight here. And so I reduced it and said, okay, let's do black and white. And this is like, the important thing. So that's also maybe, maybe a big difference. Like, in the tennis project, we try to show the entire scientific process in visual form, and in that project, it's really reduced. It's a single, single thing that we're focusing on.

I'm just having a project, we worked on this for a year now and we had the first insightful visualizations after one year.

And it was really, they thought, okay, I'm here now and I'm the thing 3d guy. So I got a lot of like comments like that and was like, no, I'm not that. That's not what I'm doing.

And it's also like, I arrived here, nobody told me, hey, this is what you, what you need to do, or this is what, what I'm like, what I'm supposed to do. But it's like, okay, talk to everybody and figure out what you want to do. And so it's very open and I had to find my role in this. And, and one interesting thing is everybody is plotting here. Like, it's like everybody is doing charts. Yeah, like, I came here and Laszlo himself. So our professor, Laszlo Barabbasi, he's an extremely visual person, which is, I think that's why I'm here. And he's very much interested in art and he's very. So everybody, presentation anybody gives, it's like actually a series of charts where they try to explain their findings. So I really had to find my role in this. And I think one thing is that I can provide this, like, more complex arrangements. And the other thing is, like, interactivity. And I've got a different view of looking at the data. I'm often, like, making charts that more. Okay, let's. Let's go really deep down and look at one individual, but then at all the dimensions of that one individual and not at like millions, and then have, like, this highly aggregated scatter plot.
