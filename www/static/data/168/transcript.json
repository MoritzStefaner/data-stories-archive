There are a lot of events and things that happen in there, including industry tracks, and there's an art section. So over the years, it's been expanding in a way that is definitely, it is an academic flavor, but it's not only academic. And we tend to talk about a lot about the papers that get published and presented there. But there are many other events going on, and I think today Tamara is going to talk about some of these events. There are panels, there are workshops, there are keynotes, there are awards, and many, many other things. As I said, there is an art track, an industry track. So I also just want to say that summarizing what happened at this is basically impossible. So we're going to talk about a tiny, tiny fraction of what happened there this year. But yeah, I think it's better than nothing. And we will add links to videos and papers and documents. So definitely go to our blog post and check it out for if you want to dive right into.

So the keynote was Marti Hearst of Berkeley, and her talk was called show it or tell it. And it had this great framing context where using these large language models is now a thing. And so her framing context was that there were these dolly images as a bunch of the slide backgrounds, and she included the prompts that made them. And her whole point was that language should be considered co equal with the visualization part. So it was all about this sort of text and images working together towards a goal. And I very much liked it. It's exactly my jam. It's starting out with references to that Scott McLeod understanding comics, which still holds up to the test of time, all the way up to some book that I clearly have to read because it's called Proust in the squid with the tag of we were never born to read. So I'm like, oh my God, I have to read that. And I thought it was very nicely done. She really talked about language as a user interface for visualization, and that there may be ways of using it that instead of coding or a gui, what if you can just speak? A theme that others also talked about is the speed of improvement of natural language methods with these huge models these days with GPT and Dolly, and so she really wanted to draw the attention is community to the way in which text and visualization can work together. So I thought it was very well done and very engaging.",

      "text": "What if we leap all the way from the keynote to the capstone? Because those are the two bookends of the conference. Oh, it was so cool. So this guy, Kerry Magruder, who is this historian of science. So it turns out that although I did not know it before I got there, that Oklahoma University has this astounding history of science program and these archives, and he dug into the archives to come up with this talk on Galileo's telescope discoveries, thinking visually in the history of science. And the capstone didn't just start with the capstone. It started the night before where they had an open house at OU. And I was like, okay, yeah, maybe I'll see some demos. But there was this part where he went into the climate controlled archives and brought out the books, and there was this room full of books where we had to, of course, not touch, but look at these amazing source materials. And so seeing these physical books that you hear about them, but to actually see them with your own eyes and see the scale of some of them, some were huge in terms of fold out things, that was pretty magical. And the talk itself, I really did love. I thought it was one of the top three capstones I've seen at VIS in 30 years. I feel like sometimes people just sort of give their same old, same old talk, and sometimes people actually kind of rise to the occasion and really try to think about the intersection between what they're expert in and what the vis community might care about. And I feel like this was one of those where he had this sort of ternary triangular coordinate system where he thought about what it means to have naturalistic visual evidence, like what Galileo actually drew as logs when he looked at the moons of Jupiter through the lens, versus didactic purposes, which is what he put in the starry messenger book that's so famous, which is not a naturalistic picture at all. It's actually trying to specifically show things. And he talked about shadings of craters and the line of the sun versus evidential. And then he talked about how 40 years later, Hevelius came up with this full selenographia book, really trying to chart exactly what all is on the moons in terms of its craters. And I really liked this versus just a plain visual aid, which is just trying to help people see and think. And so I really appreciated the way he sort of unfolded these deeply historical things in a way that felt totally relevant for today. So I loved it. Many other people did, too.",

But the one I want to go deeper into is the one from Casey Fiesler, which is at believe, which is one of my very favorite workshops. It's all about methods, and I'm a methods geek.

And it really went deep into there's all these sort of facile things you can say, like, well, ethics is what the ethics boards makes you think about. No, wrong. That's not what ethics is. It goes deeper. And if the data is public, everything's fine. No, wrong. Look at all these ways in which things can go to hell. So it was just a bunch of, like, you might think it's so simple. No, here's why it's more complex. I think one of the ideas that I hadn't quite heard before that I really liked is the idea of ethical debt, which is this analogy to technical debt, where you sort of don't deal and suddenly later it comes and whaps you upside the head.

And it's an interesting ethical dilemma. They're quite common in visualization, I would say. Yeah. And for ethical debt, I never heard of it, but it sounds. Yeah, I can certainly relate.

It's basically like, let's go talk to people that are actually doing data analysis and vis in sort of business y settings and find out what there is to know. And this from a methods point of view, these interview studies where you are doing semi structured interviews and you do qualitative data analysis to try to figure out what are the themes and what could you learn. They often precede many building visualization projects and there was a time in vis when it would have been hard to publish those, when the only kind of work you could do is like, here's my new technique. And doing these kinds of studies to figure out but who is doing what now, what are they doing, what are the pain points, what needs to be done, I think is super valuable. And so of course they went off and they ended up founding Trifacta, which is a nice success story spin off, but based on the kinds of insights you get when you go talk to people about what they're doing.

I feel like it's kind of a testament of, like, because this idea of design studies as a way to say, let's do really, really problem driven research and try to valorize actually solving problems of people. And, wait, how do you do that? And this paper came out of, we did it wrong many times. And I mean, we also did it right many times. But trying to figure out a, what, you know, if you're just sort of striding through the wilderness trying to figure out, how do I even do this work? How do I do it successfully? How do I write a paper about it? We ended up coming up with a process that at least we found we were able to consistently get good results with. And I think one of the most useful parts of the paper is the giant list of 30 plus pitfalls of don't do this. Here's how to avoid it. And sometimes we did it wrong. Sometimes we were papers who did it wrong. Sometimes we read published papers who did it wrong. And so all the ways to get stuck, we wanted to help route people around those quagmires. And the nice thing is, there's just been this incredible explosion of work where there's a lot of really strong design studies these days where, and this is not the only methodology paper for it. There's a bunch of papers that continued on, some of from us, some from others, but the community has really done a whole lot of super strong work in these so called design studies. That's the part that's made us the.",

      "text": "Yeah. So the gist of it is that you are doing, you're working on a real world problem, and you're trying to solve that problem of real people with real data sets. So it's typically the standard approach is that it's very collaborative, like, you just can't do it on your own. By theorizing, you have to actually talk to the people. Usually lots of trying to understand in the terms of another paper on the nested model. You're really trying to understand their abstractions, take what they do and cast that into more abstract language so that then you can think about how you could build a visualization system to solve it. So a lot of work on understanding their task and data at an abstract level, and then it's inevitable that to actually build something, it's got to be iterative. You've got to have rapid prototyping, really try many versions, check back in with the people. So there's often a kind of iterative development and deployment stage, and then often to try to figure out. So, hey, wait, did this work? You often really try to get people to use it in their daily work practice. It's a thing where you build it and then you watch what happens. Sometimes they use it the way you thought. Often they use it not the way you thought. But rather than trying to run an empirical study that's a controlled experiment in a lab where you've got a little stopwatch telling people, do this task, instead, you're like, here. Here is this tool. Let me see what happens. And they're often verified through these case studies of like, well, first they tried it on something they already understood. And look, it took them 15 minutes to figure out something that maybe would have taken them 10 hours without this tool. And then they used it to do different things that they had not already anticipated. And often it's describing the kinds of things they could do with this visualization tool that they would not have been able to do without it, or that would have taken them much, much longer. So you don't have to invent new techniques to do design studies.",

And I will encourage for folks who did register online, there's this fabulous browse by serendipity where you just keep, you can keep hitting the show me a new serendipity set. And it's just a way to really get a sense of the breadth of the papers, because there's hundreds and we are only covering a tiny few. Having said that, there was this session that made me super excited, which was on transforming tabular data and grammars, and there were several papers that I really liked in there. There was animated Vega light. So that was from Arvind Satyanarayan's group. So first author Jonathan Zong and Josh Pollock and Dylan Wootton, and they had this really nice kind of framing abstraction where you think about time both as a way to visually encode data as an encoding channel, but also as an event stream, and really reflecting on that dual nature. And so I found that to be a sort of interesting paper that, for those who don't know, Vega Lite is sort of built on top of D3. And there have been a number of projects originally coming out of Jeff Heer's group. And Arvind was a former PhD student with Jeff and is now an assistant professor at MIT. And so continuing this line of work of how it is that you can sort of think systematically about these things, I think is really one of the strengths of visualization. Another one that I liked in the very same session was from Andrew McNutt on no one grammar to rule them all. A survey of static visualization, dsls, where DSL is the acronym for domain specific languages, and it included, I mean, there's the paper itself, which sort of goes deep into a nice analysis of all these grammars. But he's got this great accompanying site, viz jsondessels dot netify app, where you can actually start playing around with these hundreds of systems yourself. And so it's been more and more these days, the thing in visualization that when there's a survey paper people build these interactive faceted browsing sites underneath it that lets you take all the data that they painstakingly gathered and browse it yourself for your purposes. And it's such a great thing that it's a thing in the field. There were, you know, this was not the only paper. There was some, unlike ML, there were several of these survey papers that let you browse underneath. Also, he had a zine. He made a zine for this. And he.",

And so that's Guozheng Li, Renfen, Li Zicheng, Wang Qi, Harold Liu, Min Liu and Guoren Wang. And what they did in this paper is they really, like, everyone in their pet cat thinks about tabular data.

So this year it was virtual but hot off the presses are a few new ones coming out. So Neil Richards has a book questions and Dataviz. He's someone who comes out of this Tableau community very much a practitioner. Lovely book of questions with some tentative answers and then even more questions unpacking all kinds of stuff about when to break the rules, when to go beyond standard chart types, what there is in life beyond a bar chart and then there's this other one that's going to be coming out within a month, I believe making with data it's all about data physicalization. So physical design and craft in a data driven world it's this kind of all star cast between the editors and the authors. So Samuel Huron and Till Nagel and Lora Oehlberg and Wes Willett and then a bazillion people that contributed and even the book cover itself is a data physicalization of the structure of the book so very meta because we all love meta. So super excited about that. I can't wait to get my physical copy. And Nigel Holmes, we have a book from on joyful infographics and he's someone who definitely comes out of the practitioner community did a lot of extremely high impact work and it's all about humor and joy and Jen Christensen is having a book coming out soon, building science graphics. She's been very active in things like Scientific American and many, many other places and Allie Torben actually did the covers to both Jen's book and Neil's book in a lovely circular way that the community all has ties to each other. We've got even more that are becoming out but those are the ones that are coming out just in the next two to three months. So we are very. I mean we want books from everyone. We want academics, we want practitioners, we want textbooks, we want beautiful books, we want everything in between. We want edited collections, we want single author manifestos.

And plotly from Jonas and Jeroen Van Der Donckt and Emiel Deprost and Sofie Van Hoecke. So, like, just, you know, my jaw kind of dropped at the demos. I'm like, wait, that was really fast. That was a lot of data. How did you get some second response for that data set? Holy moly. Yeah, so that was cool. And, well, I should. I mean, we also had some papers. I, of course, think they're fabulous and lovely work on them. And actually, both of them were originally published through TVCG and then presented at VIS, because that's a channel that a lot of work gets more and more coming in. There's a. The vis proceedings are a special issue of TVCG, but then also, any TVCG papers on viz that wannabe can be presented at IEEE viz. So there's a lovely relationship between journal and conference. TVCG is the journal Transactions on Visualization and computer graphics. Yeah, it's the journal. So we had one, which was sort of fun with deep graph models, or rather, graph neural networks, gnns. So our paper is called CorGIE, and it has various dog related menu items and corresponding. A graph to its embedding is where we came up with that acronym. And so it's all about trying to see the. Basically, it's, you know how when you go on a car trip with the kids in the back of the seat, and they keep saying, are we there yet? Are we there yet? It's answering the are we there yet? Question for people trying to train these ML models where you're like, has the model actually learned everything it's supposed to? Let's check visually. So, understanding the sort of topological structure of the original graph that supposedly is getting reflected in this high dimensional embedding in a latent space that you could then use to understand so kind of topology space and this latent feature space and attributes on the graph itself, how do you actually see what the heck is going on? Because of course, as you might guess, it's complicated. And any of these super high dimensional spaces that you're doing ML on, it really helps to try to see what's going on. So that was a fun project that was. First author is Zipeng Liu, he's now assistant professor at Beihang in Beijing, China. Yang Wang, who started out at Uber and is now at Facebook. J\u00fcrgen Bernard, who's now an assistant professor at Zurich University. So that was a fun one to present. And we had another one, which is called GEViTRec. So, data reconnaissance through recommendation using a domain specific visualization prevalence design space. First on that was Anamaria Crisan, who's now at Tableau Research, and Shannah Fisher, who was an undergrad at UBC at the time, Jennifer L. Gardy, who at the time was at UBC School of Population Public Health and BC center for Disease Control, but is now working for the Gates foundation on malaria stuff. And me and so, and Anna's got a great blog post on the Tableau engineering blog that's sort of the super easy to access and think about version. And then of course, there's the paper itself. So we were happy to have those both presented to the world. And Gevitrec is all about, how is it that you could recommend automatically. So let's say someone flings a pile of datasets in your lap, what is going on? You don't want to spend hours, weeks, days, months, kind of carefully designing a visualization. You just want to get a quick sense of what's there. So this world of automatic recommendation, where given data sets, you try to figure out, well, how are they connected up? How could we help you see where they intersect and overlap? And then after you get that quick look, you could decide where you want to go deeper. But having the system that's built in r, that just lets you type, show me what is there, and have that be something that you get in a second or two, is super useful for this thing we call data reconnaissance of what is going on in these data sets.",

If you just read the research, it just falls short. You know, things about 3d versus 2d. How many annotations could you cram into a single display?

So I suddenly care quite a bit about what's going on with review and thinking a lot about what various folks think. Lots of people. Cody Dunn, Alex Lex, Torsten Miller, Alvitta Ottley, Melanie Tory were the speakers. It was organized by Bob Laramie and Petra Isenberg and Tobias Isenberg. So I think if you are interested in those things, it's definitely worth seeing some of that. The part I'm going to tell you is that Melanie Tory had the most fantastic extended metaphor about what kind of a dog you should adopt as a pet compared to what kind of paper types you are reviewing as a vis reviewer so cute. Pictures of dogs pointing out that you want the best of both worlds, that a Labradoodle is both friendly and doesn't make you sneeze. And how does that connect up to the different kinds of hybrid paper types? And it shouldn't just be a monolithic, do this and nothing else. Papers don't have to be like purebred dogs. They can be hybrids. They can be mutts. So I liked that one.",

I'm like, we need paper types because it shouldn't all just be technique papers. But it's 2022. We already have these very fine grained idea of contributions in the call for papers. Now, it's not just monolithic types, but it's good to know what they are. So you can break the rules deliberately, knowing what the rules are.

Of the walled garden, where if you work in the walled garden, you feel protected and you know your place and you belong. But what could be beyond that? And you know that, you know, the early work in visualization with Mackinlay and Bertin was all about the atomization of design, you know, reductionism, and really thinking about this question of visual variables. But what about expressivity and how this new technology could allow us to do things and how to even. You know, many people don't think of that as being visualization. They think about it as being graphics, but maybe not vis. Joe has actually made me rethink my hatred for Chernoff faces because of a point in that essay, which is interesting. I'm still not in love with, but at least I'm pondering. But his sort of central idea of our walled garden remains home, but those distant lands beckon.
