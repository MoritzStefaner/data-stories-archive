He did a few maps that were showing kind of where activity was happening around the US, around marches against the Iraq war, things like that. And then in 2004, they asked us to work on a project that was sort of like an online call in show with a live map component that would allow people to see where in the country other people were at that point. We had just recently seen a project from IBEam in New York called Fundraise.org comma, which was not quite live, but up to the month live visualization of election finance information, basically individual submissions from people of money to. To various political causes. And it was the first time I had ever seen data mapped on a national scale in quite that way. So we did this project that was basically like a live call in show that used a real audio stream to broadcast audio, and then people would log in with their zip code to a flash map, be placed along with everybody else that was on the map at that same time, and be able to see if they were in a kind of crowded, left leaning county, Orlando, completely desolate, you know, nowheresville, up in Wyoming or something. But we actually designed a full backend system to translate that information into maps for everyone. And I think at its height, it had something like 50 to 100,000 people on this thing.

And what they did was they produced hardcore GIS software. You know, things like view sheds and hydro analysis and bathymetry and political boundaries, you know, all kinds of really, really high end, powerful, expensive tools for doing geography. What we started to see in the early two thousands, that was really fascinating to me, and this is even true from a job that I had before stamen, where I was working for a public relations agency, was that you started to have availability of open datasets. At the time, it was pretty primitive. It would be like, I don't know, a CSV file of cities and latitudes and longitudes around the world that would allow you to do a city scale map showing, you know, offices for a business or something. Pretty primitive stuff, but very open source and very open to the possibility of kind of hand tooling visualizations of that. When we did the move on work, I think I was actually doing my own sort of equivalent of shapefiles in Adobe illustrator in order to get a particular type of cartographic generalization, partially because the tools didn't exist, and partially because I didn't know about the tools that did exist in the burgeoning open source world. And then I think in 2004, everything just completely exploded. I mean, you had Michael Fruman and Jonah Peretti doing fundraise at I beam. You had the mapping hacks book from O'Reilly written by Skylar Joe and Rich. And then later that year, or maybe even the beginning of 2005, Google Maps came out and just completely changed the landscape.",

But unfortunately, what the tool does is it forces you to step through a number of questions in order to see data. So you come to the site, you have to accept a user agreement of some sort. You have to tell it where you want to look, whether it's a zip code or around a school, tell it what kind of crime you want to look at, basically this kind of like, short litany of questions, and then it will show you a very primitive looking map of your data. Okay.

And so the feedback we got from it after we launched was just wonderful. I mean, we had, I remember in particular, one guy mailed us from one of the downtown districts and said that their monthly meetings with the police had totally shifted where previously the police would tell them what had happened, and they would have to kind of process and respond to that at the time. And then subsequent to crime spotting, they were able to come to the police and know exactly how many robberies or car thefts there had been.

And once you're doing something fairly complicated, it's really easy to get in over your head with, with XML stuff. So I designed a CSS syntax which compiles down to Mapnik. It basically turns itself into XML. But the idea is that you can express things in a way that's declarative, the way that you do in a web browser for HTML, essentially.

      "text": "I think the biggest gap, the biggest opportunity, and the most exciting thing that I'm seeing right now is the new availability of data and the increasing availability of data in forms that are easy for people to digest and consume. So one of my research projects over the past few months that I've been sort of unemployed and experimenting with stuff, has been thinking about how a dataset like OpenStreetMap can be available to people who are not database jockeys on their own. You know, currently, for example, like if you use tilemill and you want to style a base map, there's a huge slice of stuff you need to know about under the hood in order to get to that state. You have to understand post gis, you have to download the planet file. You know, it's almost 30 gigs today. It's just colossal stuff and a gigantic pain in the ass. So one of the things that I've been exploring for the last couple of years is how can you get data that's open and produced by this community into a form where it can be sort of nibbled on in small chunks and approached in small ways by people who want to make something local? So a few years ago, I started out something called the Metro Extracts project. Wherever I chose cities around the world and created extracted versions of OpenStreetMap shapefiles just for those cities, so that if you lived in Chicago or New York, you didn't have to go dredging data from the open street map server. You could basically just download something really quick and use it.",

And what a map tile is, is essentially a standard for how you cut the world up so that you can layer images on top of one another and get a nice looking map out the other end. It has some particular benefits for the engineering of this stuff, because it means that when you render a particular map tile, let's say, for part of a town for one person, then that same image can be cached and represented to somebody else later on. So it's essentially the way that Google and the company they bought to build Google Maps, and then everyone since then has made it possible to do worldwide map coverage by essentially repeating these tiny little square PNG and JPEG images for people.",
