I don't know if I've ever mentioned that on the podcast, but we are working with ProPublica and developing some software to help them look into millions of reviews from Yelp. They just published their second article based on the analysis that they conducted with this tool, and I'm really excited. Some of the stuff that we do is actually useful, at least to some people within ProPublica. So they've been analyzing Yelp reviews to actually look into privacy issues and the fact that doctors sometimes reply to reviews, customer reviews, and disclose information that they are not allowed, allowed to disclose.

So invested heavily in just learning how to code, and instead of just doing these small side projects, spending my waking hours just doing one project at a time, rather than dividing my time between a full time gig and hobbies, nights and weekends, I've been doing these side projects and publishing them on my personal site, essentially like a mattdaniels.com. and then about six or seven months ago, I started another site so that it could grow bigger than myself and have a little bit more serendipity in terms of how the stories could be larger than the individual pieces and turn to just a broader idea.

So, Matt, I would like to dive into a couple of projects we selected directly. You have many, many more, and I really encourage our listeners to just go to your website, which is polypgraph co, and see all the amazing projects you published there. So we will be focusing on a couple of them. And I would like to start with one about music, and it's called the most timeless songs of all time.

      "text": "Yeah, this was actually the first project on polygraph, and by the way, we've upgraded the domain to polygraph. Cool. No hyphens and codes and just way easier to remember in water cooler conversation. Yeah. So the timeless project was actually the impetus for the site. It was the first project that I decided not to put on my personal blog and make it on this new thing. And the story behind that project was, and this is like, about nine months ago, September of 2015, is I was walking down the street listening to, I think, back that thing up to keep it safe for work, this podcast by juvenile. And I was like, this is a good song, but I wonder if. If my children's children will hear this song and think about it as fondly as I think about songs from the fifties, like by Frank Sinatra or Ida James. Well, they think it's really absurd that this was a thing in the early two thousands. So from there I was like, man, it'd be really interesting to see what's still popular today from maybe ten or 1520 years ago as a way to start predicting what is standing the test of time. And will there be an instance where in 2030 or 2040, people will look at our music and it will be just as much in the zeitgeist as a Frank Sinatra is today? So, yeah, that was kind of the spirit of the project. And then the way it manifested into the article was getting Spotify data for a full year. We used 2014 data since this was published in 2015, late 2015, and looked at what is the most popular music today from the nineties, the eighties, the seventies, sixties, etcetera, on Spotify, which is a really interesting measure when you consider that, all right, music from the fifties is now 65 years old. We probably are at a point where it's reached an equilibrium where, yes, our children's children will probably listen to the same sixties music as we did. So, yeah, so we had a really, we had a lot of interesting trend data to work off of. And, yeah, that was the spirit of the project. So you can go to the site and look at what is the most popular song from the nineties and also see where back that thing up stands.",

So I think, and please correct me if I'm wrong, most of your projects have a similar style. You start with a big title, some text then you have some interactive charts, then more text, then more interactive charts, something I really, really like. And you talk about the data analysis behind it, how you collect the data and provide quite a few details, and then you do the analysis itself and describe what this means. So in this case, you have one chart where there are, like, songs placed in a graph, and you can see how many songs from the nineties. Right. It's called what's remembered from the nineties. And you have each song represented by one dot with the face of the main singer behind it. And you can see on the far right there is Kurt Cobain with the most popular song ever. It's, what, 50. More than 50 million plays and. Yeah. And you have many others on the left. Yeah, it's very interesting. And I think what I really like of the analysis that you made and how you comment on this is that, especially on this specific piece, you've been commenting on the idea that there is a difference between songs that are still popular today after many years, and now they scored back then in Billboard and similar charts. Right. And not necessarily the most popular song back then are those that are still popular today.",

      "text": "Yeah, I think that's the most interesting part from a story perspective, really ignoring the visuals for a second, is that there's definitely a tension between what's past popularity not necessarily correlating highly with present day popularity. And the implication of that is you can take single ladies by Beyonce or a Taylor Swift song and say, okay, that's so culturally pervasive, we can't imagine a world where your grandchildren would not know that song. But there are also plenty of examples from the fifties and sixties and seventies where you had effectively, the singleties of their day. The number one songs that were so pervasive and charted at number one for so long that you couldn't imagine a world where people in 2016 would not be listening to it. But there are actually plenty of examples. Then, actually, the inverse is also true. You have arguably underground songs, kind of like Alana Del Rey song from today that surely is popular, but isn't Taylor Swift, Beyonce popular. And they have actually grown significantly in popularity over time, far outpacing the popularity that they had when they were released. A good example of this is Eddie James at last, which actually charted on Billboard, however, did not chart very well. Not in the top ten, just for a week or so, barely registered as, for some reason or another, slowly grown in popularity over time. And I think it's now like a popular wedding song. There's lots of reasons why it's played so often. I think it was played at one of us, President Obama's. Maybe it was his inauguration. Either way, it's used very often. It's in a lot of soundtracks and a lot of samples. We could argue about why it's popular today, but regardless, it has gotten more popular. So those are the types of interesting trends to find in, in the charts. And because they're coded, you can look for the songs and look for the trends and see things that I would have never been able to see on my own.",

      "text": "Yeah, a lot has changed over the past nine months in terms of designing these articles with the one that we're talking about. Generally I try to avoid any initial analysis. I have an idea of what the data looks like, but I don't really know what it says until I make the chart, which is a little bit counterintuitive. I think most people from a data visualization perspective will do the SQL queries, do the analysis in Excel, run the models, run the regressions, and then have an answer and then try to visualize the analysis and say, okay, here's the thing that I think is interesting in the data. So they have an insight and they try to represent that insight via some chart. So I don't do any of that. And it's very problematic in many ways because I don't know what I'm trying to visualize. So instead of trying to visualize the insight, I'm actually trying to visualize the data and the story. So I avoid any SQL queries or Excel analysis. I don't actually know what the data says until I actually see the D3 visualization in the browser. So for example, if I wanted to visualize the top 90 songs, this chart specifically was very weird, but I didn't know what would be number one. I mean, I had an idea, I peaked, but I didn't know what would be number two and number three until the chart was made. And I was like, oh, this is interesting. Look how far number one is from number three. Or I would make the chart and it would be maybe a boring table and I'd be like, oh, here's what's number one, number three. But it's really not that I don't see anything interesting in this. So I would try another chart until I really see something interesting in terms of what the variance is among the top 50, which is really high for the nineties songs on Spotify. So really it's just keep trying different visualizations until you see answers to your initial question, which was in this case what is still popular today from past decades.",

I went through exactly what I've talked with you all, which is you have songs that were effectively the single ladies of the fifties that aren't popular today. And it's really hard to say in a chart and really easy to say in prose. However, I am trying to get to a point where I can carry the story with just visuals and as little sentences as possible. From a work standpoint, it is making that first chart, making sure it answers that initial question that I had, and then flushing out the nuances in the question, such as that disparity between historic and present day popularity in further charts, and then, obviously, some pros to connect everything together.",

I, for instance, like the fact that you start from a clear question and it's an interesting question, then you go about trying to answer that specific one, and then you make it broader. Right. And another thing I like is that you first try to list the facts, what you can read out of the chart. But towards the end of your article, you kind of try to see, to generate hypothesis about what phenomenon is behind, or what causality exists behind the facts that you extracted out of data. I don't know if you do this on purpose or just you happen to do it this way, but I find it really, really interesting. So, for instance, just to give you an example, in the same piece, we are talking about the timeless songs. I think towards the end of your article, you talk about why does this happen? Right? And you come up with hypothesis about why does this happen? That some songs are popular when they are published, but still they are no longer popular after ten or 20 years.

If I were to start off with a chart that is just purely about the present day popularity of older music, and I think the whole data set was tens of thousands of songs, it'd just be an overwhelming visualization. People will walk into it and say, this is too complex. I don't know what it says. So I purposefully narrowed the data set just to the nineties. And I've done this on almost every project just to get to almost like a moose bouche for the article of like, okay, I'm picking up what you're putting down. This is an article about whether no diggity is still popular today relative to smells like teen spirit. And that, I think, builds the mental model to then go look at 50,000 songs as play counts by by year. And then also their historic billboard data, which is again, like we're talking about hundreds of thousands of data points. But once they have that mental model built with that small chart.

CartoDB is an open, powerful, and intuitive platform for discovering and predicting the key facts underlying the massive location data in our world. And recently they announced to partner with Mapzen to provide location data services, which you can use either inside CartoDB or even license to use in your application. They provide custom base maps, which are customized raster and vector maps supported with worldwide coverage. They also offer geocoding services so you can turn plain text into location coordinates using the built in Geocoder, and you can custom geocode your data by country, county or municipality, choose from high accuracy street addresses, or map your locations by any global postal code. And they also provide routing services. So based on OpenStreetMap's road network data car, two DB's routing services provide easy driving, walking and cycling, and turn by turn directions. And it also includes a cool feature called time and distance isolines, so you can draw on a map how far you can actually get with 20 minutes of walking, for instance, from a given point.

And they had this comic strip that was again, a half joke about the lead in the comic, only wanting to see movies that fit three different criteria. And the criteria are there are two women who talk to each other at some point in the movie about something other than a man. And there's some additional criteria that people have added over the years. But that's the spirit of it. It seems like an embarrassingly low bar that there are two movie easily passes that, right?",

      "text": "How hard can it be? Well, that's the joke is that. I mean, and the sad fact of reality is a lot of movies don't pass this test. In fact, there's a site kind of like Wikipedia called Bechdeltest.com. or you can go and Wikipedia esque crowdsource whether movies pass or fail this test. So you could probably go to this site and see any movie that's in the box office today and either see its rating or add your own rating. And by rating I mean whether it passes or fails the test and each of the three criteria. So I knew about this test and had a question in my mind that the results of the tests were less a function of systemic sexism in that we just don't want two women talking to each other about men, but rather most movies are written by men. And you would expect a bunch of men in a room to not write very inclusive stories from a gender perspective. So the question I started with was, if you took all the movies that pass or fail this test, to what extent is that a function of the gender of the writers and the producers and the directors? So there was roughly about 5000 films on becktoltest.com, comma scraped all those films, got the results and yeah, it was pretty obvious. Like when you have at least one woman on the writing team, the rate at which movies pass the test goes up dramatically. And when there's an all women writing team, it's something like 95% of films pass this test. When it's just men, it's about 55 or 60% pass the test. So it's pretty obvious. And who knows if it's right? I didn't run any crazy modeling and correlation. I was just like, here's the data. If you want to question the statistical significance, everything's open source and downloadable and you can do your own modeling. But here's just the high level results for the layperson.

I don't want to go into depth about exactly what was said, but most people, the reason why the Bechdel test exists in many ways is because there is a, well, almost like undercurrent of what is perceived to be poor gender inclusivity in film. However, people perceive that there's reasons for that. Such as, all right, we have a lot of war movies and historic movies, like, are you gonna cast all women in saving Private Ryan? Which is a fair point in some ways. Yeah, maybe. However. However, that's one movie, and Hollywood puts out lots of movies. So what would often happen is we get stuck in the discourse of gender inclusivity around these points of, well, what do we do about war films? And people pay for movies. So if they're paying for all male movies, do we want to change the economics? And should we censor writers? Should we force them to have more gender inclusive movies? So there was just a lot of things wrong with the current discourse. And what people got hung up on, on the Bechdel test was a very biased test. And when you look at whether movies are pass or fail this test, the test is so emotionally charged. And not only that, it's kind of a crappy test. So you have movies like Jurassic World that pass this test, but really don't do anything from a gender inclusivity perspective for women.",

Again, I just taught myself Dakota a year ago, and she helped out getting the data for the revenge project, which was to kill the Bechdel test as this measure for gender inclusivity and actually get better data, which we decided would be just looking at raw dialogue by gender. So instead of saying, okay, we're going to have this imaginary test that Alison Bechdel used as a half joke in a comic strip 40 years ago, we're going to have a another way to quantify gender inclusivity using just the percent of dialogue from screenplays that are men versus women. So that's, again, not a perfect measure, but in my opinion, way more way an improvement over the Bechdel test for all the reasons already discussed. So that was the second project and the one I really want to talk about, which is film dialogue broken down by gender and age. And that project came out a few months or in April, and it did really well. And I think is also directionally more of the type of work that I'm hoping to do in the near future.",

And there's a reason why no one wanted to quantify it because it just takes a lot of effort. And we can go into the technical side of this, but we spent six weeks just gathering data yeah. And that was a labor of love. Also a very stressful experience because as you can imagine, screenplays are one of the art is getting dialogue from screenplays is not a structured data set at all. So that was a fun experience, but also one that I felt was really just needed to improve and move forward the discussion that we were having around this topic.",

Or just methodologically, we're using screenplays, which already means there's going to be issues with how accurate that represents the film, which is obviously a product of the screenplay. So that alone means there's tons of errors. But if you accept that, generally there's not a huge. There isn't a consistent shift from the screenplay to the film. We still have directionally accurate data. But anyway, we chose to go with screenplays. There's other ways to go about this. You could use onscreen dialogue, which means you'd have to watch the film and then categorize who's talking and how long they're talking. That's an option. But we chose to use screenplays. And the idea was, could you break down the screenplays by character? And then you would have to. Once you had that. So we have, the lead character has 8000 of the 12,000 words uttered in the screenplay. And then from there we have to figure out, well, what gender is this lead character? And we methodologically went with connecting the lead, the character name to an actor on IMDb or like the cast list, and then the actor to a gender so that was the thread. That was the thread through the needle that we needed to figure out was screenplays to characters, to actors, to genders, and do that 2000 times and with as little error as possible. So that was the complexity of the project. And the most amount of complexity was just in. Screenplays are formatted uniquely every single time. They're not always text files.

So the timeless project was adding data to talk about, well, why do some songs stand the test of time?

And then future projects will try to move that even farther. And I do hope that one day I figure out how to pay for this and get sponsors.
