I came to London and I actually landed my first job in advertising and I was an art director for about five years. So I worked for ad agencies and then slowly and not fully aware of it, I ended up working with data. Well, I kind of did a couple of self initiated projects that led me to a very nice opportunity a few years ago to actually create a book, all with data and infographics. This is the infographics history of the world, published by Harper Collins in 2013. There was a collaboration between myself and James Bohr, a data journalist that used to work for the Guardian for the Datablog. I guess that kind of cemented my profile into the database community and into the infographic world. So since then I kind of left the advertising field and I moved towards more like, what is interaction design based on data or experiential design? All around data editorial design that includes infographics and data visualization. So yeah, many different types of work, but kind of focused around information design and data visualization.",

Our engraved plexi records. And yeah, each of these discs looks at a different aspect of the song, be it the rhythm or the content or the melody or the harmony, probably. So there's ten different lenses through which you can look at the song. And time always starts on top and then goes in a full circle. Like the full song is basically once around the clock on that record. And, yeah, they are very minimalistic in style. It's all black and white, monochrome, very clear shapes.

      "text": "Dumplings and beer. It's the source of all good ideas. We got chatting and we realized that we both wanted to work on something to do with music. And I'd obviously studied music, and I'd really felt that I hadn't done very many projects, very many information design projects on music, and I really wanted to do something that used data from music. Actually, as part of my PhD research, I had been analyzing recordings of performances by a classical composer called Anton Webern, and I'd been using some particular software to gather the data from recordings on things like timing and intonation. And I was quite keen to apply that to other types of music and also to collaborate with somebody who really had some amazing design skills and make something that was much more creative. So that was kind of where I was coming from. We did initially, I think we discussed working on a book together, and then we quickly realized that we didn't actually want to do a book. We wanted to do something that involved making data physical in some way. Creating physical objects out of sound was something that both really inspired us a lot. We weren't quite sure what we were going to do at first. We weren't sure what music we were going to use. And then David Bowie actually died in early 2016, in January 2016. And then Valentina got in touch with me and was like, why don't we do something about David Bowie? Because we'd both been listening to Bowie's music on loop after he died. It really brought back just what a great songwriter he is. And I thought that was a brilliant idea. So we decided to do something on Bowie, and I guess we knew that we wanted to be quite systematic in our approach. It was going to be, I guess we were thinking along the lines of, either we do one song, we look at one song in great detail, and we take many different approaches to that song of many different angles, or we look at many different songs using a particular methodology or set of criteria. Eventually, we settled on, let's just look at one song and let's look at it in lots and lots of different ways. You know, look at the melody and the rhythm and the harmony and the lyrics. So, yeah, then we chose space Oddity. And I think probably just because it was one of the most well known songs and we wanted to have something that people could relate to, something people would be able to, when they looked at what we'd made, they'd be able to somehow relate it to the remembered sound that they'd heard. And also because it was one of his biggest songs. It kind of broke him as an artist, and it's one of his really early, really works as well. So, yeah, that was our initial impetus for the project.",

      "text": "Yeah, it was a journey, I would say, first of all, you kind of need to understand where to start because, you know, the starting point is a song. But usually when you approach a new task or a new briefing, data visualization, you're either given a story that you want to represent with data, or you're given a data set, and then you need to find a story. Right. That you want to represent. In this case, we didn't have either. We didn't have a story. We didn't have the data. We just had a song. So we kind of had to find our own data and our own stories. What do you want to visualize of this song? And, well, obviously, there were so many stories that we could possibly visualize, since the song comes with a very rich cultural connections, like, from the contextual time that it was created. So if you think about it, this is, like, 1969 is the first moon landing of humans. So this kind of context, historical context that is great is also very closely related to cinema because there is a really strong connection with Kubrick 2001 Space Odyssey, and they also informed the title of the song. So we started to kind of create this kind of, like, context around the song, as well as understand all the different elements that the song had. Narration, lyrics, repetition of the actual structure, the structure itself, the instrumentations. And then we kind of just went into this journey of getting lost into these many layers, trying to see if there was a way that we could possibly link them all together. So we came up with this system where everything was kind of connected by the time we thought, well, if we're going to break it down in so many different layers, how can the user then put these layers together? If we have a consistent way to represent time that is actually the five minutes and 20 seconds of the song, then you can easily draw connection between one layer and another and see what's going on and perhaps look at the lyrics and what part of instruments are playing in, what type of. What type of story has been told throughout. So, yeah, that's kind of like the journey that we went through. And obviously, once the data was collected. So let's say we decided to look into instrumentations. Once Miriam actually collided all this material into an excel sheet, then we had to define how we're going to visualize it. So the actual visual language of each data visualization. And I wanted to kind of create a cohesive language but keep a diverse look. So I wanted every output to be different, you know, to look different. And then I suppose, like, the initial research of, like, all these contexts and the references and inspiration, they really gave me this grounded approach of our direction. And this is possible, like how I inform all my projects. I try to get inspiration from the material that I'm working with and trying to use that to inform my style or to inform the way that the data visualization is going to look like. So looking at space travel, looking at the moon landing, looking at Kubrick, I started to develop these very minimal, bold a bit, maybe, I don't know, cinematic look and feel like black and white, light on the dark, to refer to space. Yeah. And I suppose, like, giving myself these sort of guidelines and quite a stronger direction guided me throughout the process, hopefully keeping the outcome consistent in a way.",

I tend to like a lot projects that focus on a very specific thing, but going in depth, I think that that's somewhat rare. I like it a lot. So one thing that I want to touch upon is more on the data generation step, as you mentioned at the beginning. I mean, you started the project, but you didn't really have data. And that's, I think, another interesting trend. Some of the best projects out there seems to be projects that don't start with data, but start with a very initial, very good initial concept or idea. That's definitely one of those cases. But in this case, generating data is pretty hard, I guess. So what did you do?",

Some of it was actually gathered using a kind of semi manual method. So there is a tool that I used a lot in my PhD research called Sonic Visualizer, which is a really good kind of open source tool that was developed by the Geiser Queen Mary University of London. And it's very good for musical analysis. So you can feed an audio track into it. And then one of the things you can do with it is actually extract timing data from performances. And the way that you do that is you play the music, and as the music is playing, you tap on a keyboard every time you hear a beat or a bar or a particular melody note or whatever it is that you're tracking. Then you can manually adjust the taps so that they, they form lines on the waveform on the screen until they fit with the waveform image. And also you play them back in the tap because at the same time is the bit of the audio you want to capture. Then you simply extract that data as a kind of text file. So you have a concrete record in data of a particular performance. So if the musician speeds up or slows down, you have that timing data, and you can then obviously plot that. So it's a really cool tool. And I used that for the rhythm record, which was the one that looks only at the bass and drums part. And that was particularly labor intensive to gather the data for. I think that was probably the most difficult one because I had to go through and literally tap every single bass note, every single drum hit in space oddity, and then get all the taps correct and then export the data. So that took quite a few days. And Valentina actually gathered the data for one of the records, which was the. The lyrics record, which has got these word trees showing the grammatical structure of each of the lines in the lyrics. And it looks really beautiful. And I'm totally in awe because she studied grammar at school and she can actually do this stuff, and I didn't study grammar at school, and I can't do it. So I think it's fantastic.",

I don't actually have it, but I think you can use it to extract pitch data from polyphonic recordings. So recordings that have got more than one part, and that's quite cool, but I haven't actually experimented with that. I guess the final record was slightly different because it was actually gathering data from people. We asked people, we asked 36 of our friends. We basically just sent an email around to all our friends and said, will you listen to David Bowie's space Oddity? And here's a chart that you can plot your emotional response to the song on it. So we got them to basically draw a line in pencil or on a PDF or whatever, and then we had to somehow get that data and analyze it. And I think we. What did we do? Trace the lines? And then we used one of those tools, those kind of online tools, to export an image into a data file. Then I interpolated some points in r, and then I found the mean emotional reading per second.

There's an awfully broad number of instruments. You've got a couple of flutes in there. You've got a whole string section. You've got the lead guitar and the bass guitar and the drums, as usual. And then you've got really quite an unusual structure to it. So it's got quite a weird verse. Most songs sort of go, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, break chorus, and then fade out. This is not like that at all. It has a very unusual chorus that isn't really a chorus. It sort of goes here, am I singing in a tin can? But it's a bit of a letdown moment right at the point where you think you're going to get a chorus.

So you kind of go into this new sphere of perception that becomes more experiential, I suppose. Right. Because you listen to the music, but you also see it. And then. So that was kind of like the core aspect of the project. And then when we actually were offered the opportunity to do this installation with Widen+Kennedy, and we were offered the window as well, the gallery space inside. We were like, wow, we've got all this space, we need to fill it. No, it wasn't just that can't just be a website. Yeah, but, yeah, obviously the records by themselves, they're a bit abstract. Right. Unless you have the key and legend and all the information to be able to decode and to extract the data visualization and to read it, they are just abstract pieces. So we created this poster to keep this cohesive visual language of just black and white. So we actually use beautiful white ink printed on black paper for these large scale prints. And then we also decided to embark on this quite ambitious thing of creating an animation. So I remember sitting down with the rest of the team. So Miriam, probably on Skype and Widen+Kennedy, we had Mike Naiman and Genevieve Sheppard, and we were brainstorming what this window should have been, and somebody came up with idea, what if we actually have a projection and the records are brought to life? And I was like, yeah, this is great, but let's please not go down this route, because it means, like, not two weeks worth of work, it means two months worth of work. But obviously, everybody fall in love with the idea of actually seeing the music. I mean, listening to the music and seeing the visual, reacting to the music, and not being a developer myself, not being a coder, I did try to explore how to use processing in the process of actually creating the data visualization. But I actually got quite frustrated by the fact that because I was beginner, I was learning by taking tutorials. So breaking free from the templates was actually quite hard. So what I ended up was just replicating what other people had already done, and I didn't want to do that.",

And I didn't want the animation just to look like somebody's else work, you know, but just plugging in our data. So I reached out to Mike Bronberg, who is an excellent coder. He works with processing, and, yeah, we collaborated together to do this piece. I did part of the animation in after effects, and he did all the reacting symbol to the sound of the music in processing. And it was a very good collaboration. Although on my side, the process of actually learning didn't stop because after effects was exactly like my preferred tool either. I did use it in the past when very limited scale, and being an art director, you kind of like, used to create your storyboards and then have a team, they actually execute your vision and they execute it usually even better than what your vision is. While here, I had my vision, I had my beautiful storyboard. But then I didn't have the actual skills to execute it. It was quite challenging and frustrated, but I took on the challenge and with the support of lots of YouTube tutorials, I did manage.",

      "text": "Oh, I think probably if it were to go back and do it again, I think we would probably both try and do a song that was a little bit more obscure or was out of copyright. Because copyright is an issue when working with music, particularly when you're working with music by a major artist like David Bowie and UK copyright law. I mean, copyright law everywhere is pretty stringent, but in the UK you have sound recordings that are actually protected for 70 years from the end of the year in which the work was first released. So David Bowie is still well within copyright. But equally, you know, if you were going to do it that you would want to go for a song that you really love because you are going to be listening to it a lot. So I guess one avenue that it would have been really cool to have done but we didn't really have time, but was to create 3d printed objects out of the. The same data we did. Valentina looked into this option, but we really ran out of time. But it would be nice to have something that was really. And budget. Yes, of course there was something that was in 3d space. You know, we thought about visualizing the waveform. One of the discs looks at the waveform of the eight separate master tracks and we thought that would make a really cool 3d object with the different kind of waveforms actually textured in space.",

So learn something new with any personal project that you do, I think is quite important, whether it's a skill or the field that you're actually exploring.
