In fact, I work as a self employed truth in beauty operator out of my office here in the countryside in the north of Germany. And usually I record this podcast together with Enrico Bertini, who is a professor at Northeastern University in Boston. But today I'm solo. But luckily, I'm joined by two guests today, which you will hear about in a minute, just in terms of introductions. On this podcast, we talk about data, data visualization, data analysis, and generally the role data plays in our lives. And the topic today is data design themes, design systems, style guides, guidelines, design languages. You can already see there's a whole cosmos of new formats emerging here in this space that we want to explore together today. And, yeah, hopefully you'll learn something new. And it's an exciting new emerging field. Yeah, I hope we can shed a bit of light on these mysterious terms before we dive right in. Just a quick note, our podcast is listener supported. We don't have any ads, so if you enjoy the show, you might consider supporting us. You can do this with recurring payments on patreon.com Datastories.

And we sort of uncovered this whole world of, wow, there's so much happening in this space, and it's also really hard to orient yourself. Like, it sounds so easy. If somebody says, oh, we need some database style guide or guidelines. Can you help us do that? Everybody's like, yeah, sure, that sounds great. And then once you look into, oh, what do we do? What do we actually do now? What do we offer? What's the format? What's the scope of the whole project? You realize, oh, it's not even that clear. And everybody needs to figure out what they are doing in that space. And so, yeah, so there's so many flavors and approaches you can do. And so, yeah, I got in touch with you, Alan, and a few other folks who have experience in the field to help us guide along a bit. Here we are. Yeah. So I know both of you have been working on these types of projects. So before we go into all the nuances, what the differences between different sub genres are, maybe we can start with the purpose. Like, what, in your experience do people hope to achieve when they start building a design style guide or start formulating design guidelines? What do you think? What's the hope connected to that?

What are our standard colors like, how do we lay out this particular document type? People need standards to communicate in a unified way. And one of the things I like about this space is that there's just such a broad range, as you already touched on, of ways to answer those questions.

Just the idea of answering questions faster. So just people being able to reuse design to know what to do, all these things come into efficiency, consistency, which I think is the one that people don't always see. But for an organization being able to reproduce a design over and over or reuse some time of, let's say, I have a set of rules and principle that they can build upon scale. And I think Alan is going to know that more than me. And then the one that I don't see often, but to add Pentagram and in my work, that's pretty important, which is recognizability. So in those guidelines and style guide, the idea of being able to produce something that is recognized by an audience, like brand them, and we don't talk about that often in Dataviz, but that's really important to me when creating style guides.",

But in this world, it's very common to have like a big bug with the fonts we use. These are the colors we have. This is how we pick photos.

      "text": "Yeah, cool. So I think the motivation is clear. So you want consistency, you want to scale design, you want to make sure all outputs coming from one source have a minimum level of quality. They are recognizable, they look from the same family at least, and not have that be a mysterious process that some gifted rockstar designers can only do but sort of scale the capability to anybody, ideally, right. That, oh, with the right rule set and the right tools and the right building blocks, anybody can now make a chart that looks like coming from that organization and is solid. Right? That's the hope. It's a big goal, of course. But now we're looking into, okay, how can we enable that, right? What are the things we can supply? And this is super crucial, to be clear about that. That's a trap I ran into in a few projects that we weren't really clear what the difference is between a style guide or guidelines or a component system or, you know, like all these things. And then you realize, oh, they actually wanted to have a big book with lots of data, with do's and don'ts. And we were like, oh, we thought we were just designing a database theme, like, pick some colors. Right. And so there's a whole spectrum of possible outputs you can have. Right. Maybe. Let's talk about a few of them. And I tried to organize it from small to big, sort of. So I think the smallest thing is probably like a design theme, where you say like, oh, these are the colors and fonts you can use for a given chart, something like this. And maybe a brand has multiple themes, like a light theme and a dark theme. It's like a skin you can apply to a chart, like an excel template type thing. Maybe then the next step is maybe a design system. Alan, is spectrum a design system? Where is spectrum on that ladder?",

And I think we use it pretty freely in the design world. We use it at least in the brain side of things. We use it kind of like whatever, we can exchange them. However, I could see your difference where for me, like one guideline could be like do and don'ts versus a style guide is kind of putting all those guidelines together. So to me, style guide is a collection of rule. You know, it tells you what you're allowed to do and not to do given a context. And I guess I'm going to go one step further. But there's to me, the style guide. If you think about if you remove style and you just keep guide, then you can also include elements of voice, again to that branding element. So not just doing dance on design, on color choices, but yes, on tonality, on content, on way more than just the look and feel and, you know, the practicality of design elements. So that's how I see the difference in guideline and stygal. But in the design world, we definitely use them almost as exchangeable and that.",

We really struggled to articulate and structure the guidelines in a way that would make sense and be relevant to our users. And we still have a long way to go. I feel like the guidelines right now are pretty basic, but yeah, we have that. And the primary purpose of our guideline is to help people who are building software.

I think the one that's the most public that you can see on the Pentagram website is the Deloitte Insights. It's a guideline and template, so it's not full design systems. And so Deloitte Insight is a magazine. It also has a web platform attached to it. And previously, before I even joined Pentagram, the team with Giorgia Lupi had actually built guidelines for them before editorial datavis, so were more creative applications. So that was used only by information designer that already knew the roles that were pretty comfortable with it. Talking about audience here. And the issue that came back when they came back was that we cannot give those guidelines pretty much to our normal designers. So the team actually use external, a lot of external designers that are around the world with different backgrounds, from different countries, and they produce like hundreds of Dataviz per month that I put, and they're quite fast, so fast turnaround, little supervision. So we were in contact with more of the creative direction marketing database team within the organization, not so much the designers. So we had to create templates and guidelines knowing that we have no contact with the final designer that's going to use them and they are not specialized in information design, not always, at least. And they have a high turnaround themselves because they're external contractors. So it had to be pretty.",

And this one was tricky because we had to do it, and they hadn't produced any work yet. It was made simultaneously to a brand, and so they knew what type of data they were working with from scratch, but they had non produce anything, so we didn't have anything to even review. We had to do from start, and we had to make sure it would be used by designers and non designers for social media PowerPoints, anything possible.

What I like to do is a bit more of like, if it's, it doesn't exist anymore, it's kind of like doing design first and then link that back to the foundation of. I find it difficult to build the foundation first, decide the colors, everything without testing them because you're going to end up changing them. So I tend to, even if the project doesn't include making templates, kind of templatize a little bit, like test out some basic charts or things they use regularly to see if we can start finding patterns and put that back into guidelines. So that's kind of how it works. The only added thing that I do, and then Pentagram does too, is what we call creative direction, which is maybe a little different than a traditional style guide, which we're trying to find. What makes those days evolution stand out. How do we connect them to the, like, the voice of the brand?

So PowerPoint, canvas, row, graph, the easy building blocks that can be reproduced and used for anything report. But then we usually have a second section that's for designers and information designer, and that's. And sometimes it can overlap a little bit of, like, it can be very simple things that you can do, like, I don't know, adding a shadow, adding a texture. Photography, how do you use photography? Do you crop it? Do you not crop it? Is it a textured, is it black and white? Is. Does it use a color? So. And this is.

But for us, and one of the advantages of being an internal team is we can deliver things incrementally. Right? It does, it's not a single deliverable. We can do something and then add to that over time. And so that's the approach that we've taken is, and we try and prioritize the most important, most valuable, the things that are going to have the biggest impact and then keep adding to that. And at some point we'll reach a threshold where, you know, the incremental value isn't worth the incremental cost, be that, you know, actually monetary costs or just cost and complexity, because as your system grows, you can't grow indefinitely or it becomes unusable because it's too big and too complicated. So we're starting to run up against the bounds of what we feel is an appropriate level of complexity. But yeah, we do start with the end in mind.

You need something visual to work with and to debate. At the same time. You feel like it's such a big system and if we just keep making graphics, it's never be a proper system system. And so when do you introduce these rules? Or do you redo all the example charts you did before? If some design decision changes, like how do you keep it dynamic? Also, one thing I found there is this design tokens approach that I'm super excited about. So if you're a bit technical inclined or you like coding anyways, then I think that's worth looking into because it's a really neat way to store all the basic design decisions in a standardized format. Ideally, if the brand color changes or if the background color changes, it all trickles through your implementations. And there's also the risk that you then keep perfecting that system and it's kind of becomes a little hobby to clean the token structure and rethink about the hierarchies then. But I think that helped me a lot to think about. Okay, what are the building blocks like? We need a background color. Oh, we also need a sort of a shaded background color. Or we need two text colors, or maybe three. Right. And give them names and, and not name them by how they look, but what they do. Oh, it's the high contrast or the low contrast version of it. And that helped me a lot to think about it in a structured way on the basic Lego building block level, and stay flexible in terms of, oh, I think we should change the text color on all charts.

Not to say that agencies don't play a role in creating some of the initial work or coming in and helping you audit it or bring new life to it, bring new ideas. Sometimes things can get a little stale internally because you're just kind of recycling the same set of ideas among the same set of people. So fresh perspective can be really useful. I also think it depends on nature, your organization, how big it is. Right. If you are a relatively small startup, you can't spare even a single person to run a design system.

For a new client, for instance, I change it every time. Everything, including the basic charts or the decision charts. I decided what chart to use when it's different for every client, depending on the topic.

I think this, because we can't teach them design, we have to give them really precise rules so that they can. They don't have, they don't have the understanding of what, you know, the right spacing in text hierarchy, you know, and so we see it regularly when researchers make PowerPoint right. No offense to researchers out here, we respect you. We used to be there, we know how it feels. But I think sometimes they just don't have the sense, they don't have time to even learn and we don't want to make them designers. So it's more, those rules can also be set up sometimes just to actually help them without having to, like, give them free workshop on how to do Dataviz. It's just like here, is it easy? You just have to follow this exact, you know, guidelines, this exact pixel, this exact branding corner in your software. We give it to you so that you don't have to think about it, really, and to make your job faster. Otherwise, interpretation is nice, especially as designers. We know how to do things so we feel more comfortable taking some freedom into interpretation of the guidelines, but I think for other users, it might be really important to just help with that and just give really precise guidelines.

We have such a responsibility to do them properly. So not just for the users, are that they usable, easy to understand, etc. Etc. But I think we need. To me, the big caveat right now, guidelines, is we don't approach like ethics in database and guidelines. We're like, here's the job. This is how you make it. Especially when you're like me and you work with a lot of data, like social data, so bad. People. Of course, I think it's getting more common. Accessibility, some kind of rules.

And I just, I want to start those conversation with, you know, maybe we shouldn't. The colors matter, but maybe we should also question, like, should guidelines also offer more guidance on when do you actually need to do which database should you be doing? Like, should you actually emphasize differences between social groups, ethnicity, for instance? Like, we have research nowadays that shows that maybe it's a problem to raise awareness this way. And I'm wondering, and I know it's a little further than what designers are. I think we get caught into the detail of design, but at least designers like me who work on guidelines for those big organization that, you know, approaches, like sensitive topics. I'm just wondering if there's a place for us to be more responsible and think twice about the work we do and give guidance on maybe even terminology. How do we use ethnicities text? Can we promote transparency in how data is sourced within the guidelines? I think there's so much more we can do with it that's not just design related. So I guess that's my big statement.

So I think I'm really excited for the next ten years because I think not only are the tools that we use to do this work going to continue to evolve and change and there's going to be new ones and things, I think the work that comes out of those tools is going to be better too. I think one of the challenges to being creative isn't necessarily the systemization, it's the feedback loop. Right. Right.

Like, I wonder how much, when I'm seeing AI, my journey, like, how much of people who are creative but never got the chance to be educated have the time to learn Photoshop can produce art. You know, there's so much obviously, it's a little further away from a discussion, but automation and all those tools that are going to make our work practical is also going to allow more people to join the community of design. Like designer is going to take a bigger umbrella. Maybe we'll have more people with different opinion and different background.",

Yeah, no, but if you could also, like teach, as you said, a design idea or like a principle or like a certain approach, and then just see a hundred variations of that, I think that's, that's exciting. Yeah. Cool. So I'm glad that the positive spin to a slight doubt at the end, but I think there is an interesting tension there. And it's what I also want to keep exploring, like how can we make work that lasts and is really professional and solves people's problems, but also still keep things exciting and inspiring and provoking also sometimes, right. That's the eternal design tension that we all have to deal with. Wonderful. I think that was a great conversation. I hope we didn't confuse you all with our design system nerd talk. We'll put a few links in the show notes to the examples we discussed, a few resources, and yeah, maybe we can do a follow up episode on AI plus design systems now that we are all excited.
