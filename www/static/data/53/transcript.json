Yeah, and then I decided I really should try to open up my scope and see what kind of else is around there. And I quite like the RCA program, the design interactions program, because it's kind of. I mean, yes, it's a lot of art, but also it tries really to, to look into technologies from many ways and also this kind of notion of speculative design, so that you kind of come up with scenarios which kind of try to make technology debatable and maybe even sketch out a bit alternative ways or alternative paths into the future. I was quite intrigued by that, and I had a tough time there because, I mean, with my applied background, it was, it was really tough at the beginning, but then after a while, I just accepted all those influences and also the great diversity of design in a way.

But I think it has been super influential and the approach is quite unique. So maybe the basic idea is instead of designing for needs today, as you would learn at a normal design school, this program, you basically design things for the near or intermediate future, but very concrete pieces, more or less, that would sort of play with future scenarios and what the role of technology might be in a few years ahead. They're super nice. It's always a bit cynical, critical, dark, but also whimsical, often what comes out of these investigations. And it's just, it's been a crazy program.

The project is a collaboration with him, with Joey. And we had like a lunch conversation and I've told him this question and he's coming from LA or he spent quite some time in LA and he was immediately intrigued in that question and he said, like, you know, I have no idea, but let's check out where there's a data set for that. And it turned out that there is not really a data set available for it. But then he managed to come up with some high resolution satellite imagery for that area, like really, really high resolution and also with additional channels, not just RGB and so on. And back then also it was harder to get this kind of data and. Yeah, and then at the beginning we were quite naive. We were thinking, this will be a piece of cake. With this satellite imagery dataset, we just detect all the blue colors, like, you know, from the magic wand tool in Photoshop. Blob detection, da da. You go and then you have it. But of course, reality is tricky. We ended up just with glitch, basically. You know, with this kind of simple detection, it's really hard to distinguish between a blue roof, a blue car, a blue everything. But still, we were kind of really intrigued by that question and we didn't gave up back then and we had a hard time to think alternative ways of how to approach the thing. And then we stumbled accidentally kind of on those services in India. Clipping path services in India so for the ones who are not familiar with that, it's basically a service for online shops. So normally if you go to Amazon or any kind of online shop, you find all the product pictures in front of a white background or a white background is most common. And these services in India, you send just their product images and they kind of clip out or trace out the product and kind of separate it nicely from the background with a Photoshop file. So you get a Photoshop file back with a clipping path vector in it which you then can use to kind of clip out the product from the rest. And that made us then wonder, maybe these guys can help us. And then we started to experiment with those services and kind of did variations in the instructions and so on. But basically we asked the people to clip out in the satellite imagery, the swimming pools. And then after a few initial tests, we received then this massive dataset back, I think with 60, 65 or something, 68,000 nicely clipped busier path. And, and then we were like, we were just like, this is crazy. I mean, in so many ways because we didn't pay a fortune for it. So we had really a bad conscience. Like, you know, this is like, this is crazy. So then this made us really think, like, hey, from something cute like a swimming pool and a, suddenly you end up at cheap labor expectation in India.

And then we had this kind of vectors, then georeferenced again, and then we applied quite a few gis things like, does that make sense? And we tried to eliminate doubles and these kind of things, but still it was not kind of good enough because we had like 60 something thousand. And the problem was that the people in India were a bit over motivated, so they traced also like blue roofs sometimes, or blue other things. And also, to be fair, the resolution which we had in those images is not like the one I think it was like one Pixel a meter or something, or a bit better, but it's whatever. If you go to Google Maps and then you zoom whatever to zoom level 20, which is I think the maximum zoom level currently Google has, or the other, the other image providers, then we get a lot more resolution. Again, as we treated then the question, serious, we thought that, okay, we have to cross check now all that things in the highest possible zoom level to validate whether it's really a swimming pool or not.

So we did in a database, then outsourced it to Amazon Mechanical Turk, where people would get a snapshot of that location with the highest possible zoom level, which Bing provides Bing maps provides.

One thing which we did is then first, what we did is then to enhance the dataset with additional things. So, for instance, as we had the vectors of the pools, we could calculate the water evaporation, or we could calculate the address, or like, I mean, in America, it's in general amazing what kind of data is available. We could calculate how much the properties or how much the property or how much the parcel is worth in a. Worth which the swimming pool sit on Orlando, the zoning code, like lots of stuff even. We managed to crawl a database with sex offenders or crazy stuff, basically. And then we had a really massive data set with a lot of interesting data points. And then we did a few things. So one was the Spikadlas of elliphels, which is a series of books with 74 books and 6000 pages. And you have, for every neighborhood, whatever, Hollywood or Santa Monica, an individual book.

Maps got better so you have more zoom levels. It's, you know, it's a really nice haulover for the whole. Already working quite well and so I can definitely recommend to try it out. And for your free trial you can visit Tableau software at Tableau. And now back to the show. And now you have another satellite imagery project, so we can briefly talk about that. That's a fun one.

I think while we were doing the big atlas of LA pools, we spend a lot of time in front of our computer staring on satellite imagery. And at some point we maybe. We probably developed an obsession with satellite imagery, not sure whether it's a healthy or an unhealthy one. But basically at some point we realized that a lot of stuff in the satellite imagery is also. Maybe you could also say that this is maybe a letter or something else, so that it is kind of a. So that has sometimes a great ambiguity between it's a building, but also it looks like an a or there's an island, a tropical island, but it looks also like a heart. We thought, this is interesting and maybe we should do a project around that, basically. Again, kind of a silly question this time. Not really how many swimming pools, but more like, hey, can you find with some kind of computer magic and with a clever way, all features in satellite imagery shaped like a letter form. And then we decided to do a kickstart on it, mainly to share the process and kind of to engage already from the beginning with an audience, because the big Atlas and Felipe project doesn't communicate well, I think the process behind it. So I think the project works quite nice. If I do a presentation before, or if we do a presentation, but not really, I mean, not so good in a way, if it's just in the gallery and you kind of stumble across the books and kind of. The Ariel bowl project is an attempt to showcase that process and kind of to share that process with the people. So, I mean, we raised the money and it actually took us quite a while to create.

So, for instance, the sourcing of all the training data is done with a crowdsourcing tool, where we ask our backers or other Internet folks or friends to help us. It's a gamification thing, so you have a nice interface for it, and then you can start to find those letters, and then there's a high school list, and then you get credits for it, and I mean, all the details, like how can you define the study areas? Because, I mean, the world is quite big and you don't want to send people to the Sahara desert, which, where obviously no letters are around. So it took us quite a while to find a methodology which is based on population density and so on and so on. Or it's quite hard as well to write that classifier because you need training data, but then you need also a classifier which then crunches all that satellite imagery and detects all the letter forms. And so we are collaborating on that end with Hochschule in Regensburg, Weingarten. And Ankita is like doing her master thesis on that classifier. In a way, I think it's really like the project engaged with a lot of people and with a lot of different domains. And again, we are really hoping to kind of showcase and then maybe document.

So a year ago, so Wolfgang Fengler from World bank and Casey Samir from Iasiz in Vienna approached me and were saying, we have this really nice asset. So we have a global dataset for population and also with predictions and with the history and so on, and also quite a sophisticated math to interpolate missing paths for every country and everything. Then we did several workshops and then decided okay. We want to have basically two leads. One is we want to showcase the data set and make it accessible to a wider audience so that people can engage with it. And the other thing is that we want to make it accessible for other institutions or for other data science persons or whoever is interested in population data. And then we build an API for it. It's quite nice. I think it's probably the first time that you have this kind of detailed dataset so nicely accessible with a lot of endpoints, right? Yeah, and, yeah, and then we did the website population IO and got quite a lot of nice responses, TED talk on it as well, and quite a few things. Yeah. And basically the website is just like, you can enter your country, your date of birth and your gender and so on. And then we get several pages of several kind of data visualizations which try to make that topic and why it's interesting and why we are living in such an interesting time in regards of off population data, just kind of to make that tangible and hopefully bring the point across. I mean, it's really intriguing because at the moment I think we are really living in a unique time of human history because all those big shifts in population, they are happening in a relatively short period of time, which is now between 1900, that between 1950 and 2050, the population will grow from two and a half million to 9.5 billion. So, like in our life, like all those big challenges will be.",

So the central question is, what's my place in the world population and how long will I live? So you start, of course, with the individual and then sort of tie all the statistics you present to you as a user, which is, I think, a very nice way of approaching this topic.

It's a bit like this effect. I don't know there's even a name for it. If you read a newspaper article on a topic you know well, and you realize the journalist totally got it wrong, and then this next second, you think like, oh, it has to be like this with all the articles.

And I think these things are changing there as well. I think this is a trend that you can see everywhere.

There is one thing that, there is one project that maybe you guys know that has been very, very successful along these lines that is called fold it. I don't know if you know it. You know, fold it. Moritz. Very interesting. So this is a guy, I think, from the University of Washington, who developed a game on the web on folding proteins and molecules. And actually you're. So it looks like a game. It is a game, but in reality, you are trying to find new, I think, new proteins or new arrangements or something like that. Now, I don't remember the details, but you. What happens is that the outcome is that through crowdsourcing, using this crowdsourcing kind of game, they manage to find new molecular structures. So there is an impact on science, and this is big. So I think there is this whole idea that people like to participate when they see that they have a role in the process. And I think this is true for your project as well, Benedikt, that people like to feel like. My guess is that people participate because maybe there is one letter that you're gonna put in the final database that come from me. Right. It's a nice feeling. It's a very nice feeling.
