So it says that it provides a concise syntax for rapidly creating interactive visualizations. And these visualizations, they support data exploration and analysis at the same time. The way we've designed this language is that it's an extension of the grammar of graphics. And so that way we have high level declarative language. But we extended this grammar of graphics and added these primitives to also support interactions. So you can actually compose interactions through small components that you add to a visualization I think we'll talk more about the details of how this works in this podcast.",

      "text": "Yes, that's correct. So we have a few principles that drive the design of this language that we use. The first one is that we use composition over templates, which means that instead of having a specific chart type, like a scatter plot, we actually compose a scatter plot out of these basic building blocks of the grammar of graphics, which are the marks. So for a scatterplot, it's a point and encoding, which defines how data is mapped to properties of the mark. So for a scatterplot, we would modify the X and the Y position of the mark. And then there's some other things like scales and axes and legends that also work in the grammar of graphics. Yeah, so that's one of the design principles. The other is that we use sensible defaults. So these descriptions of the visualization can be very concise, because as a developer or designer, you can omit these details and the system automatically has some smart defaults. Then the next one is programmatic generation and sharing. Vega-lite was designed so that you can build tools with it. And also it's a data format that you can use to exchange visualizations between different tools. And the last one is that we leverage Vega, which is the underlying execution engine, and also a visualization language, but it's much more low level.",

In a way, it's kind of like in English or any language, you have words like now and verbs that you can combine to sentence to describe what visualization look like. Right. So grammar of graphic is similar to like this kind of language for describing graphics. So you combine things like data. How do you transform them, how do you encode them? Using different graphical marks like bar or area or line, and then how you map the data to property of this mark. So that's like the basics idea. So one of the things that we might want to compare to would be comparing to a different approach called like chart template. Like you might call things like bar chart or area chart or histogram. That's like a name, but in a grammar based approach, if you want to create histogram, then you want to think that you actually want to use bar mark to encode bin data field and account. And that's basically histogram. So it's like more like building blocks that just kind of like Lego that you combine and build like buildings in bagel. In this case we build resources.",

Because that's a really, really new element there that you couldn't find in other, as far as I can tell in previous systems they're based on the grammar of graphics and it looks to me much harder, by the way.

      "text": "Yes. So we extended the grammar of graphics. So we're still building on all the building blocks that exist there. But we've added this new building block which are selections is what we call them. And we talked about them in our Vega lite paper at Viz a couple of years ago. And the idea is that a selection captures points of interest that are somehow selected and they could be selected through hovering or clicking on points. And then there's different selection types. So we have a single selection which contains a single point, multi selection which contains multiple points, and interval selections which contain a range. And then using these selections you can drive some of the encoding. So for instance, you can say if a point is in the selection, then color it, otherwise color it by, for instance, some variable. And if the point is not in the selection, then use gray. And so that way you can use the selection to drive the encoding. But you can do this not just within a single specification, but also multiple specifications. Yeah. In addition to the extension to the grammar of graphics with selections, we also introduced an algebra for composing charts into larger multi view displays. And that's really when the power of interaction comes in, another way to use selections is to filter data or change the scales. And so that way, with these building blocks, with these primitives, you can build interactions like cross filtering or overview in detail. Zooming and panning. We don't have a zoom and pan template, but you can build zooming and panning by composing an interval selection and then driving a scale.",

Which also brings me to so one thing that I really like about that is the fact that now you are transitioning this old system to other environments, such as the world of Jupyter notebooks and Python in general. And this is this kind of environment that is typically used by data scientists as well as many other environments like that. I'm thinking about r and similar environments. One of the things that we lack the most there is interaction capabilities. And I remember when I saw that you were moving to the Jupyter notebook space, I was really excited exactly for that, because finally you have a very coherent and well designed system to not only bring easily visualization to everyone, but also interaction. And so maybe that's also a good time to introduce Altair and Jake, maybe, since you seem to be the main person behind this porting of Vega Lite to the Python world.

      "text": "Yeah, so essentially, basically what Altair is, is a Python API to create these JSON grammar's specifications within this Vega like grammar. And it was, Altair was really the brainchild of Brian Granger, who's part of the Jupiter project. And he and I, there was a data structures meetup at Berkeley a few years back, and he and I started working on Altair. And I've really been fortunate to have the time to run with it recently. But the nice part about Vega lite is that the grammar is specified in a very direct way in this JSON schema format. Through JSON schema, I can look at any JSON output and say whether it's a valid chart or not. I can also use the JSON schema to prescriptively say how we can construct a valid chart. So the idea with Altair is to give a Python API that will let you construct valid JSON specifications. And so that's a low level thing. And then what we decided to do is once we had that low level infrastructure in place where we could generate and validate basically Vega lite charts, we started building a Python API on top of it that was more user oriented. And it's, I've been really drawn to this grammatical approach to visualization, it's really, it's really opened new worlds, especially with the interactive piece of it. And so it's been quite fun. And Altair is progressing. And the real benefit here is that we in the python world, we get to benefit from everything that ham and Dom and collaborators are doing in Vega lite. Every time there's a new Vega lite release, we can update our Altair code. And the nice thing about Altair is the bulk of it is automatically generated from the schema file, so we can run our code generation scripts, and we get a new version of Altair every time Vega lite comes up.",

So the specifications are usually in order of magnitude longer. But also Vega is quite expressive. You can probably make all the charts that you would want to create in there. And so one option, if Vega-lite doesn't offer what you want, is to generate the Vega and then modify the Vega by hand to adjust it to exactly the positions of the axes and scales that you want.",

So for vector graphics and pixel graphics, there's an experimental WebGl renderer. Maybe after the summer there will be a matplotlib renderer. And so I can imagine having all these declarative languages at all these different levels allows you to also swap out what tool or library, what implementation you actually want to use.

Actually there are some examples on a website that are community examples because, because we didn't create them. But they basically use the primitive that we have in order to create new chart type that we didn't create ourselves. But then at the another level is like there are some primitive that we haven't added to Vega lite because we haven't got time then adding that is feasible. For example now we actually have map and that's actually done by undergrad student who work with us and help us Vega live with projection and then Geotf so that we can draw a map. So yes we can add more primitive too, but that would be a little harder than just compiling example because one part of the grammar is like we are designing a language and if you add new primitive to the language, if you interact with other part of the language. So you need to be a bit careful about how things gonna interact with other part. But once you add the power is combinatorial because you can combine it with other building blocks in the language.",
