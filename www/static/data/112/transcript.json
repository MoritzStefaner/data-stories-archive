And on this podcast we talk about all issues related to data visualization, data analysis, and generally how data affects our lives. Usually it's two of us. So there's Enrico Bertini, but he's missing today because I'm in London and I'm talking to Alice Tud, who does data pottery and we wanted to use the opportunity. We were both at the information is beautiful awards, and at the end I'll give you a short update on how these played out. But first, the interview with Alice. Enjoy. So I'm here today with Alice Thudt. Hi, Alice.",

Yeah, so what we are going to talk about today, I guess, is a little side project of mine that kind of got is pretty related to my PhD research, I guess, because the PhD takes over everything you do in some ways. But mainly it started because I really love to do ceramics and pottery in this project. I kind of combined my hobby of pottery with my research in personal data, I guess to create artifacts that are enriched with some visualizations of personal data, to create some artifacts that you can kind of use in your everyday life and see your data more around.",

So maybe the first one I would mention here is I made a set of two bowls about the Skype history, Skype call history with my parents, because since I'm doing my PhD in Canada and my parents are in Germany, we kind of keep in touch over Skype. And what I wanted to do there or why I thought this was a fun thing to do or interesting was because it kind of represents, like, our Skype history kind of represents how we keep in touch, how we still keep close contact. And I picked cereal bowls because these are artifacts that we both encounter every morning. So basically I kept one, they got the other one. And so my idea was that every morning we will see this representation or remind us to call each other. And so that's one example. Then I made a friend of mine in Calgary recently, like about a year ago, defended her PhD thesis. It was a really great thesis. Yagoda Walni and I made a mug for her because she loves to drink tea, so she's a big tea person. So I wanted to make a tea mug for her. That represents her big accomplishment of her thesis. So I basically visualized the structure of her thesis, the kinds of how it breaks, breaks apart into chapters, how many pages each chapter has. But basically it was supposed to symbolize her big accomplishment, kind of also as a trophy. So every time she has a cup of tea, she can kind of remember her PhD time together.",

I want to remind my parents every day to call each other and also to just feel good about the fact that we kept in touch and the teacup, just because it's something she uses every day. It kind of fits her personality in my mind. Yeah. So it always is somewhat related to the person, what kind of object I would make. Yeah.

And it's sort of organic shapes that vary in height or in size. So you could think it's just a nice decoration. Decoration. Or if you have looked at too many charts, you might start to look for the data language. So it works both ways. I think it works as just an organic decoration pattern, but you can clearly see, like, size differences or arrangement differences. So it's nicely in between decoration and readable chart, I think.

      "text": "I decide not to. I guess you could put that. But I also wanted to work, really, as just a decoration for the piece. So I look okay. What really sticks out for me and makes a representative visualization. And then once I have that, I usually modify it a bit to make it look a little bit more like. I do that mainly through sketching. Sometimes I can't. Like, for example, one I made for my dad about his biking, three years biking data. He's very avid tracker of his bike rides. I was kind of, when I looked at the data, I kind of had this idea that I wanted to look like a wheel because it's also cyclical sort of data. So it works kind of nice to make it also look like a spinning wheel. So then I have this idea, then I try to consolidate it with what the data actually look like. I do some sketches, and then most of the time, I kind of, once I have this more clear idea, I try out some. Like, if I'm not yet super familiar with the decoration techniques, because there's, in clay, there is, like, a lot of different decoration techniques. You can do, like stencils. You can do slip, which is like liquid clay that you kind of drip on, and it sometimes etch the surface. Yes. You can scratch into it. You can use pencils. Like, there's just a lot of options. And it's not directly always clear what technique will work best for this pattern. And so I try out different things, usually on little tiles that are more like test tiles, to just see, okay, what works and how does it work. And sometimes I then have to throw away my idea, because sometimes they just do not work in clay at all, especially, like, super detailed things. We have, like, a high fire kiln where I do my pottery. And that's kind of, you can't get super detailed with it because the glazes will move, and it's a very organic sort of process. So you have to kind of see how they turn out. So I do that a little bit. And once I have decided, okay, this is the pattern and the decoration technique that I want to use, then I basically create the basic shapes that make up the pattern, usually in some excel or Tableau. I've also written, like, a little program that makes it easy to kind of map it to a specific size, because at a certain point, I have to transfer it to the pot. And this is actually a little bit challenging because you need it to be a certain size if you wanted to fill the whole pot around. Yes, yes. I have to measure the pot, have to go back to my computer and make the pattern fit that size and print it out to scale, and then somehow apply it to the pot. So, yeah, so I make the basic shapes. I modify them a bit, drawing over them, and then depending on what kind of pattern it is, if it's very spatial, it usually makes sense to use either stencils, which means they cut out piece of paper, you put it on and you paint over it. Or some. Something like that. It's like that. Or to actually project it on and draw it on, which is, like, really involved process. I built a little thing with a pico projector projecting from the top in the lab to be able to do this. But it turns out that most of the time, it's actually easier to just use stencils or put some directly sort of, on the thing rather than using the project.",

But in this case, I just come across as like a pour a cup of tea and I'm like, oh, yeah, I don't know, it's kind of neat that they are so embedded into my everyday life. I really like that. What I'm starting to wonder kind of about is that if I. So for me, I found that actually the process of making them is almost more reflective than having the artifact, the end result. So I spend a lot of time thinking about the data, the relationship it represents, or the experience it represents while I make them, because I have to go through everything. And then when I have the artifact, I have this sort of story still in my head. All the things that I discovered during making them where if I give it as a gift, the. You don't share that much. I kind of talk about it, but I think the other person doesn't really have that. And I also noticed it's very selfish of you. Yeah, it's kind of selfish. I don't know if it's really actually even possible for people to read them after a while. That's why I, like, I started with these elaborate, like, patterns. For example, the one I made for my dad about the biking has, I think, like three different data type things in it. Like the distance he biked, the number of times he biked, and this, this time, and the speed or something. And I wonder if he can really actually tell which or like, remember which is which.",

If so, send us pictures. I'm really curious. As we hinted at, this was at the morning of the information, this beautiful award ceremony, and in the evening it turned out Alice actually received an honorable mention for her project. So that's wonderful. Congratulations again. Generally it was a really good award ceremony and a hugely, just great quality field of submissions and awardees. I was also lucky. So I won with the rhythm of Food Project for Google News Lab Gold and bronze for the train peak spotting project we did together for Deutsche Bahn. I'm honored here myself. And generally there were lots of great, great projects awarded. Big winners were, I think, density design. The pudding had multiple pieces and there was of course, data sketches from Shirley Wu and especially Nadieh Bremer. And Nadieh in general, I think was the biggest winner of this ceremony and she had three awards, so that's quite amazing. But there were also many other winners you might know already from past data stories, episodes such as Kim Albrecht, Dominikus Baur. Also, I was super pleased to see Miriam Quick and Valentina d\u2019Efilippo win with the audited vis project silver medal for Periscopic. So many, many of the people you might know from listening to data stories check out all the awards. Like the whole short list is fantastic actually. So go to the site and just browse the entries. There's a lot of beautiful stuff to see. And what I also really enjoyed is that this year there were even more international like non European us entries and winners. So we had winners from China, from India, from Russia, and I think it's great that we widened the horizon there a bit. Anyways, looking forward to next year. It's always a great pleasure to review the year in Dataviz through the information Beautiful Awards and yeah, I hope you enjoyed this episode. Do support us on patreon.com Datastories. We are all crowdfunded so we need your support. So if you enjoy this podcast, just think about if it's yeah, maybe you can chip in a few dollars per episode. Thanks so much and have a great time.
