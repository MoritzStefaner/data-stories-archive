So, Pierre and Yvonne, they are researchers at the IRA in Paris, one of the leading data visualization and human computer interaction groups. And the reason why we organize this, this episode on data's culture is because I met them some months ago at the Visweek conference and I saw the fantastic work they have been doing on analyzing physical visualizations, which basically means instead of having visualization displayed on the screen, there is a physical object that shows the data. And they are going to show us some of these little toys. After meeting them at this week, I actually, we stayed in touch and I discovered they have a nice webpage where they are collecting examples of physical visualizations. And another interesting things we are going to talk about today is a study that they recently run an experiment comparing different kinds of visualizations, some digital, some they're going to explain us what the results of these studies are. So, Pierre and Yvonne, do you want to introduce yourself a little better and tell to our listeners who you are, what you are doing, what are your interests? First, Pierre, you want to start?",

So we built a lot of those 13 to be exact, and we created this equivalent screen versions, and we wanted to see how they differ in efficiency, to be soft, simple tasks, to read values, to deal with occlusion, and to find data points and compare them in size. And so we compared this to the same thing on screen, which I currently cannot show anyways, it looks almost the same. Could similarly be manipulated with a mouse just by rotating it, basically these angles. And yes. So we also included two control conditions for this to see how much this is due to stereo cues. So with a physical object, you always have perfect stereo cues. So we had the stereoscopic condition with the 3d screen and a 2d control condition where we had a very nice interactive 2d visualization where you could basically get something like a top view as a matrix, and you could click rows or columns to get 2d slice. So what we basically found is that, yes, 2d works better, you get a very nice 2d cut, and as long as the task can be solved with this cut, it works very well. But the physical works better than an on screen version. And for this, this basically made us wonder why, how come? What are the benefits, since the stereoscopic didn't really help.",

And so we wanted to test this hypothesis. And so we did a second experiment where we basically had only the physical and the on screen, and we added two conditions where we tried to make the onscreen version better by giving physical control, so they rotated in the same way. They had this one, actually. So there's a sensor underneath, and it was directly linked to the on screen model so you could manipulate it in the same way. But you saw the data on the screen.

I think you saw this in some stores. It's usually more kitsch stuff like dolphins and souvenirs. But you can actually ask, can actually send a 3d model to some stores and they will make it for you. And laser etched or how do they do it? It's laser subsurface engraving. So there is a laser here, moving. Moving and which can focus at any height and extremely precise and fast. And so it creates micro. Oh, yes. It creates micro bubbles. So I wanted to see if you could, you know, which resolution you could, for example, draw characters, labels and lines. You know, those were for grid lines. It's actually very precise. And why was that interesting? It's because. But Yvonne will talk about that. With the process of digital fabrication, you cannot build everything using a 3d printer or laser cutter, because you cannot breed objects which float in the air, for example, and using laser cutting, like Yvonne did, works for three d bar charts, for example, because they can physically exist. But 3d scatter blocks, for example, you have those things floating in the air. It's more difficult to build. So with that, you can do almost any 3d object. But. So we did that. It's just a test. This was a test. We paid about \u20ac60 for that. There are several problems with that, though, and I'm a bit less excited about that now. Although some people proposed to use that already before for scientific visualization. There is an article from Paul Bork, I believe. Yes. A poster who is from University of Western Australia. Who used, who did a poster about using that to communicate scientific data. So, okay, one problem is that you can see that there is refraction, right. Some objects are doubled, so it kind of changes the perception of depth. It's a bit weird. It's like in an aquarium or when you see those fishes, there's reflection, which doesn't help reading. Objects don't cast shadows, which is a bit weird. So they don't seem really. They don't seem real, and you cannot touch them. You cannot touch the data. And that's something that we found. That. Yeah. That even found after the experiment, actually. We didn't know about that, really. We're really more interested into how people perceive those objects. But turns out it's very important to be able to touch the data for some tasks.",

But I thought, yeah, when you talk about physical, tangible objects, everyone says touch, you can touch them, but what's the point? Okay, can you have eyes? Right. Eyes are much more powerful, but there is touch and touch. So, yeah, we have. Touch can mean many different things. Touch, it can be the tactile sense. Right. It's sensing with your fingers. I think that's not that important as far as physical visualizations are concerned. But in Yvonne's experiment, people were much more. It helped them a lot because they had to. They had to mark to highlight those bars of interest and columns and rows. So it acts like a memory aid. And this is not really about the tactile sense, it's more about using our fingers to visually as visual bookmarks. But there's proprioception too, which probably contributes. So, yeah.",

And so when I started my thesis, my first project was about having physical controls for visualization, for wall size display visualizations. And after that this was kind of like the approaching this from the other end. And what about if we make the visualization itself physical and not just the control? And this was also kind of interesting since most infovis research is, well yeah, it's screen centered. Everything is about screen visualizations. And so yes, we try to approach this from the other end and see how much can we do actually already with static physical visualizations. And so this is just kind of the beginning.

So this idea of reusing physical objects, right, something that we kind of lost since we introduced computers reusing physical objects to improve user interfaces has been used almost for input. But yes, we are very good at manipulating physical objects so there can be a benefit there. And including infovis, if you look at the work info vis on tangible user interfaces, there's not much. There is Brigg Ulmer's work for example, and Petra Eisenberg too, from our team. It's all about using physical objects for input, but then the visualization is still on the screen. Right.

So this could be something like, I don't know, the brain of a human, the art, or, I don't know, one of these. Yeah, or a wind tunnel where they study a wind goes through, I don't know, an airplane or whatever. Right. So this looks to me like the perfect case where people might want to have some physical presentation of this data because probably the 3d representation, the physical representation of something that is originally a 3d object hypothetically should work better. So I'm surprised that nobody did it so far. So do you know anything about it? Are there any, do you know if any researchers did similar studies to yours in the past that are more focused on the physical representation of 3d phenomena?",

And it's true that these days, today, maybe 99.9% of physical visualizations come from design and art. So there is a huge variety of things, very exciting things, and people like it. I mean, they keep emailing each other about, oh, look at this, new data sculpture. So yeah, this is a big trend and we've been partly inspired by that. But, and I will maybe talk about it a bit later by showing some examples. There are examples of functional physical visualizations which date back from 35 and even at the beginning of the 20th century. And they have been built for really doing visual analytic tasks. And the reason why they disappeared is very simple, is that it's with computers, because those are difficult to build and they were worth building before today, maybe less. But I think part of our work is showing that this, they are still worth investigating. Yes.

And he studied matrix reordering. He wrote a very, very interesting historical paper about matrix reordering. And he built those physical visualizations, those physical matrices, and he built different ones and he gave them to friends, including Jean Danyel Fiket. So Jean Danyel has this on his desk and he's showing it all the time. And see, look, it's very nice you can do this, but no one understands really. So I emailed in her and he explained to me how to use this and I have a demo and I can make you a demo. So this is okay. For those people who don't know, this is a matrix visualization. So why, why is the matrix visualization? Why, why is it cool? Because it can show lots of things. So those are, matrix visualization is basically a table, data table. But you replace numbers by shades of gray or maybe glyphs, whatever you want, you just replace numbers by small visualizations. This is a binary, it's just binary. Zero, one. Okay. Here it's not very visible, but it's supposed to be dark and, and, or light wood. So we can show lots of things. This is a adjacency matrix, right? So if you have a link between this and this, then you have a dot. So you can show matrices with that, weighted matrices if you want to. And you can show multi dimensional data.

It has or not a railway station. And yeah, you use those black squares. So, and actually, so inner leaves shows that those kind of visualizations which have been described by Bertin, but actually which have been used by scientists from the end already, end of 20th century, no, 19th century are very, very common. They were used a lot. And the first thing that people did to analyze data is the reorder. This is very important because, and this is the reordered version of what I showed you. If you don't reorder, you don't see anything. If you reorder, you see, you see a lot. You see groups, patterns, clusters. And reordering is very, very important. And it has been used in archaeology, for example, for relative dating, it has been used for classification, very important. And lots of people have been reordering matrices, matrix visualizations, but there were no algorithms at the beginning of the 20th century. And the reordering was done visually. It works well visually. But the problem is, how do you get from. Yes, from this, right. When you have no computer, remember, you have from this. This is, I have no idea how they did, but Bertin found a solution to that. So this is the matrix. So technologies, yes, this is a subset, actually of, this is a subset of Bertin's subset of the example I show you before, which is famous example from his book. And I will show to you how it works. So use this to move a reorder. It's a bit like a Rubik's cube. You can, if you cannot move a cell without moving either the entire column or row, okay, so there are holes. I can, for example, choose to move this cell. So I insert this here. I don't have much training, and it's very, okay, so I will put that here because it's different. Then let me move this. Okay, that's, that's fine. Here, move this here. Then, you know, this line is similar to this one. So we move it closer, make some space. I think it's the first demo of Bertin's physical matrix ever. You can see lots of photos online, but only photos, right? There is no video. I think that's true. And I think no one understands how it works.",

So one thing you often don't think about that much, but it's much easier to talk about data if you have an object everybody can look at. You know, a screen is always very, it's just for one person mainly. Yeah. But an object you can view from all sides, you can point there and somebody else sees you pointing directly. And so it has this social aspect and you can place them anywhere, so you can put them on your desk where you have a free space. And so I was wondering, you know, so now we have all these fabrication techniques. So you can mill fairly easily, you can laser etch, you can, you can 3d print. I mean, have you thought about what happens in ten years when 3d printers are maybe as widespread as 2d printers now? Do you think there will be lots of data sculpture objects around, maybe also disposable ones that you just print out for a day or two and then throw them away again and they get composted and go somewhere else? Or do you think it's going to be still a niche and will remain that artsy type thing?",

Right now you have to order it online or go to a fablab somewhere in your city if you're lucky and your city has one. But I guess the 3d printers or whatever comes next that can do the same thing will become common. And there are already many people out there who do this kind of self logging and who collect lots of data about themselves. And I think that those kind of people would probably be very interested to have an object representing all this data that they collected. And there are people working on more disposable and recyclable materials for 3d printing. So even kind of makes sense to just print an object and then later just throw it in the composter. And so there's a recycling process. It's even easier than with paper. You can do it yourself.",

And so they give the possibility to use 3d printers, laser cutters, 3d mills, to create all kinds of 3d objects and make it accessible to normal people, to everybody. You can just go there and you, I don't know, you take a tutorial for half an hour or an hour, and then you can start making things. And we are currently building such a fablab here for research, collaboration. And at the current stage, we have a 3d printer and a laser cutter. And my favorite machine is the laser cutter, since it's very fast and you can make all kinds of things which are at first 2d. So the.

But there are some based on light, so they get really made one slice at the time. This one, basically, it's like a hot glue gun. So it's a thread of plastic that gets heated and a little printer head that drives around and makes every little slice of this, and it takes forever. And so now they have technology where they use a photo resin, photoreactive resin, I don't know the correct name for this, which basically reacts to light. So you have a fluid, and light gets projected onto it with the slice that you want with a 3d layer, and the entire thing gets solid at the same time.

Sorry if I interrupt, one thing that I cannot really see how it's going to evolve is how dynamic these interfaces can be. So I think it would be much, much more valuable if we have a physical object that can actually change its shape or color or whatever in time. And it's not clear to me how far we are from having objects like this. Maybe you can briefly comment on this. I think this is what you call active physical visualizations, right? Yes, but it's not clear to me how wide is the gap from going from something like the bar chart that you've shown and stuff that can actually, I don't know, be connected to a network and change its shape as the data changes.",
