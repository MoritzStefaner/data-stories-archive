Finally, I decided to study industrial design engineering in Delft, here in the Netherlands. And it was a wonderful education where I learned a lot in many different areas. After that I did a PhD in computer graphics, also in Delft University. I was doing ray tracing in the eighties. Raster graphics was bright new and everybody was amazed if you could make a 3d picture. After a short stop in industry, I went to Nellons Energy Research foundation. There I was developing pre and post processing software, quite typically prototypes for experimental things and research purposes. But also I could do some research myself. At that time I focused mainly on flow visualization but also did some work on, for instance, interactive visualization using computational steering. In 98, I came to Eindhoven University of Technology and thought, well, let's switch topics there. I decided to start with Infofis, which was just starting up, sort of. It depends on what your markers start. But as an academic exercise, the first interface conference was in 95. So for me that's a kind of marker. And of course it was a very fascinating topic and many things to do well. And since 98, I've been working in this area, increasingly doing more and more things in the area of visual analytics, trying to combine automated methods with visualization. Now and then I make some little sidesteps in the direction of mathematical visualization, for instance.",

And one characteristic of your work is that most of the time when there is a new technique coming from your lab is just irresistible. It's cool. And I actually found this very nice quote from one of your talks that says, develop new methods that are so awesome, cool, impressive, compelling, fascinating and exciting, that the reviewers, colleagues, users are totally convinced just by looking at your work and some examples. So I'm wondering if we can start our conversation by commenting on this idea, and maybe then we can dive right into describing some of your methods and technique that you developed in the past.",

My greatest ambition and motivation is simply to make things, to make things that help people or are interesting to look at, or where you can learn something from, rather than developing grand big theory on whatever. And that drives a lot of my work. And also that's what I want to convey to my students, just try to make something that has impact, that is good, etcetera. The quote you just mentioned came from a talk I gave and the context, there was some evaluation. Well, of course we should, in the academic world and in visualization in general, always be very carefully and never say without proof that things are right or wrong, or better or worse. And then evaluation is an important part of it. Now and then I have a feeling that it's slightly overemphasized. And especially in a young generation, they seem to have an idea that if you don't do evaluation, then there's no chance you get your paper accepted. So I wanted to provoke people just by making clear that, okay, evaluation is an important step, but it's just a step. And if you want to make progress, the most important step is simply that you have to deliver. So make sure that you put something on the table that is nice and worth looking at. And of course, you can produce crap and then evaluate it and find out it's crap, but it's not really efficient. So try to develop an attitude that you can do the first filtering for the nonsense and the crap yourself, and don't be satisfied until you believe yourself in it. So that is sort of summary.",

I think that on the one hand, especially in visualization research, we try to develop things that are highly functional and we pretend in one way or another that these things should be useful. But on the other hand, it seems to me again, I was rereading one of your papers today to prepare for this episode on the value of visualization, and there is a very interesting section on the value of art you seem to suggest, and I hope I'm not wrong, that doing things for the sake of it is also very important, because sometimes they actually lead to some breakthroughs.

      "text": "Yeah, now and then you do have to experiment and see where the boundaries are. If you start up a new thing, the initiative can come from different sites in many, many cases. And a lot of my student projects, for instance, the starting point is simply a dataset, a user, someone with interest and has some challenging problem. Now then you start to work on it. Can we solve it in a trivial way? Well, if we can do that, then okay, we are done. Maybe it is more challenging, and then we start to develop something new. But also problems also come from other directions, like, hey, there's some generic problem over there. We don't have yet a user or an application for it. But if we could crack this problem, then that might be an interesting step forward. And anyhow, it's just fun to crack interesting puzzles. Some of my work was driven by that kind of things. For instance, in the area of flow visualization, I worked a lot on using texture to visualize flow. And that started really as a sort of technical problem. I had this image of, hey, you can visualize flow in a very natural way using texture. And now how to do it. My idea was, let's take some standard off the shelf computer graphics techniques, but found out, hey, there's not such a technique. So I had to develop something myself. Also, the two things I just mentioned, you have a sort of very practical bottom up approach starting from a project. Also you have the very generic approach starting with some generic puzzle. In my experience, it's always fascinating. Try to switch level all the time. If you do something practical and it's not immediately obvious how to solve it. Okay, then make a step back and try to see what the pattern is and try to solve the more generic puzzle without immediate care for the particular application domain example. In that context is, for instance, the hierarchical edge bundles of Danny Holten. Denny was doing work in software visualization and at one point we had a nice data set and we wanted to show something more about this. It was about core graphs of complex software from a company and how to see the structure. We looked at it and then we found out, hey, the real puzzle here is that you have a hierarchy, namely the structure of the software system. And on top of that you have a network. All the modules on the bottom level of the system are calling each other. So this combination of a network and a higher hierarchy, that's interesting. If you look at the world through that pattern, you suddenly find it everywhere. For instance, you have people that work in different countries, in different continents, so you have a hierarchy and they're sending emails to each other, they are friends of each other. There you have a network. And trying to understand this relation between, say, geography and communication is interesting. So Danny and I set out to develop something for that. And in the end of the day, we ended up with the hierarchical edge bundles.",

Right. And yeah, it's been a huge success and now you see it almost everywhere. So it's a very interesting method. It's one of those things. I think all great ideas in retrospect are obvious.

I guess that's what the late nineties or early two thousands, a new version of treemaps, which is actually, I guess, the most popular version of tree maps, which is squareified treemaps. So I think the story there is that. So three maps have been developed originally by Ben Shneiderman and his students in his lab at Maryland. And I believe the first implementation was used an algorithm based on slice and dice that created very long and stretchy rectangles. And then you came up with this new algorithm that actually tries to have an aspect ratio for each rectangle that is as close as possible to a square. Right. So can you tell us a little bit of the background story of this technique?",

So I thought this would be a nice topic for a master student for his final project to work on that, we found one Mark Brolf. I don't want to claim that I developed the algorithm. Actually, it was the second author, my colleague, case housing, who came up with the final idea how to implement it, and how to make sure that in a fairly cheap way, you can get much better aspect ratios. So I can claim that here in Eindhoven, I did put a problem on the table, but the solution was made by others. Meanwhile, if you look at the map of the market of Martin Wattenberg, he also already applied a sort of squarification approach, but sort of experimentally. We found out that our method was in most cases more effective than his. He used a sort of top down approach, while we used a bottom up approach. And indeed, just like with the edge bundles, I'm always happy to see how many people use it. Also, this led to a startup company, MagnaView, and there, based on work we did later on in 2005, Rolf Liegen and Erik-Jan van der Linde. We generalized some ideas around tree maps into business graphics in general, and found out that, well, you can use similar techniques inside, for instance, standard bar charts, etcetera, so that the individual items are visible well simultaneously. You also see the aggregates. So that was, for me personally, a nice and rewarding story, how one idea propagates to the next and finally reaches some audiences.",

One approach is to use, for instance, thick and thin lines, and show the high level cuts by thick lines and the low levels by thin gray lines. But quickly that becomes very confusing. As I told you just in my cv, basically I'm very much a graphics guy. So at that period in time, I thought, okay, let's put some technique from 3d graphics in there and see how we can boost the appearance. So the idea was to put cushions behind each rectangle and to stack them up hierarchically. And then you get very nice, almost like tortoise like patterns that are quite readable and help you to understand the hierarchy. I'll tell you a secret story how I came up with the idea. It might be surprising. The inspiration was music. I don't know if you know how she music looks like. In classic sheep music, you want to make phrases clear and sub phrases, etcetera. And there you use arcs to show them. I looked at those and thought, okay, what would happen if you simply stack those arcs so that you get a sort of hierarchical arc pattern? Can you generalize that to the case? Well, turned out to be very simple to define and to implement and gave a lot of nice pictures.",

If you go to an arbitrary webshop or you have to select a flight or find a holiday home, you're offered with a list of different choices and you can pick things and you see how many are there and get some statistics about it that guide you through your choice. If you have thousands of items to look at, doesn't work. If you have zero, it also doesn't work. So that's an incredibly effective technique to drill down quickly on large datasets. On the back of my head, it's hard to beat that. If you look at the problem at a higher level as selection in collections of items with multivariate attributes, it seems there's a case for visualization and a lot of people in our field are working on making better methods for multivariate visualization.

If people see something that's more complex, like a histogram, say a scatter plot, scary, scary. They already stopped with that. I was intrigued by once there was a keynote from someone from New York Times, and he said that a scatterplot, that was the absolute upper limit of what his readers could swallow. Well, in the academic community, of course, it's just a starting point. Maybe that can change in the future. Nice use case is stock markets. When I think of it, of course, this map of the market, Martin W. Very early showed how effective it can be. If it's about communication, then people don't have much time and want to get a clear message. So the visualization necessarily also has to be compact and simple and easy to understand. If you have to work first on trying to decode what's going on. And a lot of things we are doing is just quite shallow. Also in my daily work, important ingredient is about just a number of things. If there are three or five things that you have to deal with, you don't need any visualization at all. If there are hundreds of things, for instance, if you're chairing a conference and want to see the big picture, or if there are patterns, is everybody doing his job, then you find out that hey, it would be nice to have some better visualizations and better interaction here.

You have a set of items, you have the set of workers, and you must assign items to workers. So papers to reviewers or members of your committee. And of course there are many nasty constraints that some people are experts in this, or they don't want to have more than that, etc. Etcetera.

So you've been presenting a data set that comes from basically your family. It's you, your wife, and your two children, and it's four data points. And I believe something like three or four different attributes, including, I guess, age, sex, and something else I don't remember exactly. And it was very interesting. And then you start building different charts with these four data points and three or four attributes, and you go through a very long list. It's like first a bar chart, then a timeline, then a set visualization, and then a hierarchical visualization. You go through a very long list. Right. And I think that that was very, a very good example of one of the major challenges for visualization. Right. Even with such a small set of data points and fields, the design space is huge. Right. I mean, it's not huge, but it's large. Right. And I believe that's one of the biggest challenges of visualization, because you have to have a way to figure out how to decide. Right.

I gave an initial version of a talk, and my wife said, no, this part where I described different methods is too boring. So I thought, okay, let's make it somewhat more interesting. But it's also something I try to push to my students, that if you get data and people tell you it's multivariate data, you don't have to immediately believe that, and you can look at it via different lenses and then get very different results. And that could be useful to visualize things in very different ways. Having said that, it's all also dangerous, that you can quickly produce a lot of nonsense or irrelevant stuff. Yeah. There is a thin line here. I hope you can. I am sure you can recognize this. On one hand, as researchers, as designers, we have to be creative and explore the limits and to find very intriguing and hopefully impactful way to show things in a very surprising new approach. On the other hand, a lot of our standard mundane methods, of course, work very, very well. Say a histogram works quite well to show a distribution and time graph works perfectly to show a time varying signal, etc. Etcetera. A current state of the visualization field in the real world is somewhat interesting in that respect. A lot of people are now discovering visualization and they think that if you make a weird picture in a crappy way, think 3d histograms or 3d pie charts or much worse than that, you're doing visualization and by some magical way you can get a lot of insight. Well, of course we know that it doesn't work like that. So in a lot of work my students and I are doing these days, we more and more step back to very simple visualizations. And it's getting more and more rare that we find some really new visualization pattern or visualization case in interaction. There are still interesting opportunities how you combine standard visualizations in different ways. But yeah, we are sort of, maybe I'm just getting too old and running out of fantasy.

Not much of it really spectacular and things like that were not published, but it's not trivial, requires care to do it in an effective way. And it would be good if we had some more guidelines how to do visualization and then not the simple case of okay, we have one table and how to do it, but we have a lot of messy data now, how to configure different elements and what rules to follow if we put everything next to each other on top of each other, what to give priority.

Good point. Actually, there is something wrong with this reasoning. And, okay, what's wrong here is that if you want to do that, then sooner or later you have to accept cuts. So you can rephrase the problem as, okay, let's apply cuts to a sphere, say in orange. Next, try to flatten it out.

So I went to a next level. Okay, if this doesn't give you a very interesting result, are there other ways that you could try to cut? For instance, what would happen if you cut along coastlines? And then you can decide, try to get the continents together, or maybe you want to get the oceans together. And what does it look like? And you can cut in a more or less random way, or you can cut very structured in a grade like pattern. So there's a whole family of ways you can cut up the earth and flatten it out.

I think that in many real world problems, you have problems like usability, workflow tasks, etcetera. And these are very, very hard to fit into math without becoming silly or minimalistic or whatever. And it's always intriguing that if you go from physics to sociology, for instance, then physics is of course, very, very precise, sophisticated, highly, highly mathematical. Well, sociology is still work in progress. I'm not an expert in that, so I won't make any claims. I know something about it, but that's much harder to capture. And the simple explanation for that is that the phenomena you study are much, much more complex. The interaction between two elementary particles is much easier to capture in clean mouth than interaction between two humans. That's also one of the challenges and the charms of our field that try to make things precise and make a step further.
