      "text": "So, let's see. Well, so currently, as you said, I'm an assistant professor of data visualization and civic media. And those are two kind of weird things to be a professor of because they're both sort of new. And so these are kind of these titles where you say that to your family and they're like, I have no idea what you're talking about on both, but I guess the way that I ended up here makes the position make sense. So I. In undergrad? Well, no, I should. Okay, so I'm gonna start really far back, but I promise this will be short. So I grew up around computers and computer programming and robots because my dad was a science fiction writer and also worked in educational technology. And he was a really big early proponent of using computers in the classroom with kids. Okay, very cool. I was super nerdy, but not knowing that I was a nerd because it was just, like, very normal for me. I went to computer camp when I was in elementary school. And this is back before. This is back when computer camp was really weird. Like, nobody went to computer camp, but I grew up programming computers, basically. And so then when I went to college, I studied liberal arts. I did not study anything. Like, I didn't study computer science or anything like that because I was like, oh, I know how to do that stuff. Which of course I didn't, but I thought I did. But then when I was graduating from. So my major was international relations, which was basically just the major I took. So I could take the most variety of classes from all the different disciplines. But whereas my friends in undergrad all went on to be, like, investment bankers and lawyers and things like this, this was the height when I graduated, the height of the.com, the first dot boom. And so this was this kind of crazy job market where, like, if you knew the least bit of computer skills, you could get hired as, like, any kind of programmer. They're like, whatever. Just like, come, like, fill our, like, staff, our things or whatever. So I got hired as a programmer, like, straight out of undergrad and proceeded to work for, I don't know, five or six years in different kinds of, like, a startup environment. I worked at a research, as a technical project manager for a research project and oversaw developers and things like this. And then I kind of, this is where I ended up going into the arts because I was like, well, what else can you do, though, with, you know, I don't want to just build, like, enterprise project management software for Raytheon. There's got to be other options out there. And so this is where I ended up going to art and design school. So I went and got an MFA and was trying through that to combine my interests in sort of art and technology and creative expression and then with programming and things, and then, like, I guess I'll sort of fast forward. And then I spent basically, like, ten years trying to do all those things at the same time. So I was like, a freelance software programmer, an independent artist, and an adjunct professor, and I taught at places like RISD and the museum school here in Boston. And then I had kids, and then I was like, oh, my God, I have three careers. I have to not have three careers. This is totally not working, like, three freelance careers and children just, that's a disaster. And so that's where I ended up going back to school for civic media at the MIT media lab. And so that seemed to be this place where you could combine all of these things. So for me, it's like the intersection of technology, art, and design, and then also, like, social justice or sort of a kind of civic engagement and investment in, like, how do we use technology and creative expression for the public good and think about all the complexities of who's public good and what public good, and what are we talking about when we say those things? And so that's kind of how I ended up here. And so now I'm teaching data visualization. When they were hiring for this position, I looked back at a lot of my projects, and I said, oh, actually, that's data visualization. That's data. I was like, oh, yeah, I do do data visualization.

And so on your website, it says your main topics are data literacy, feminist tech, and civic art. And, yeah, it sounds so broad, but in a way, I think for you, it all comes together in this theme of feminist data visualization. I think that's also the main topic we wanted to discuss with you because it's. I first came across your blog post. What would feminist data visualization look like? I think it was published two, three years ago. I think it sort of made the rounds. It was like a very short article, but sort of a provocative idea. And also, when I read the title, I was a bit irritated in sense, like, well, what does feminism please have to do with data visualization? Right? I think this is the response. A lot of people who maybe are not so well versed in feminism and or data visualization, that's my thing. And I think many people have this first reacts like, well, do we need to bring everything in this, you know, or see it under the feminist like perspective? But then when you read the article, it totally makes sense. And I think we should talk a bit about, like, what you write there and how your position has further developed.

So maybe just, like, some clarity around what is feminism? And so there's, like, kind of two things. So one is that feminism is sort of just purely a belief. So feminism is the belief in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes. So that's a dictionary definition, and that's also Beyonce's definition of feminism. She literally has a statement where she has said that. So that makes it real. But then, so there's, like, the belief in equality, which I think, like most people.",

And so we're trying to bring that work. So there's this very long history of feminist intellectual thought and feminist scholarship in a wide variety of fields. And what that looks at is taking this belief as a starting point. How do we look at the current world and see places where it falls short and also see ways where we can basically make it better? And a lot of feminist thinking is not only about gender. And I just want to say this real explicitly, because this also becomes a confusion point sometimes for people. Like, when I start showing examples of things that are not just women specifically, only about gender. Like, it does take gender as a starting point, I would say, but it takes gender as a starting point for looking across various aspects of the world and looking at power differentials. So power imbalances, basically. Like, who has power and who doesn't have power. And often those are. It's like social power. So we could be talking about gender, but we could also be talking about race, or we could be talking about ability or sexuality or gender identity, or, you know, a whole sort of different things. But it's meaning more, like, in tune to these considerations of power and how various identity factors sort of flow into that and out of that. So I just want to clarify that because it's been interesting to give these talks in different situations and have people be like, well, like what? I don't get it. Like, what is feminism and what is this? So that's like, that's the basic starting point.",

      "text": "Yeah, exactly. And this is why also it applies to things broader than just say, if you're looking at something where you're looking at gender data or something like that. So it applies more like across the board. So when we're talking about data visualization and feminist thought, then that's where that original blog post was basically trying to really just being provocative, not deliberately trying to provoke people, but more just saying, putting it out on the table and saying, well, what would this look like? And for me, there's two main things. It's really looking at where is power located data visualization. And one of the things that we've realized actually in the process of writing this book is that there's power not just in the, you know, the data visualization is like a product of a particular process, but one of the things the book has started to do is take on all the different aspects of the process as well. From the beginning point where you're like framing the research question that you're going to somehow use data to answer or interrogate or something like that. But specifically in visualization, like, I think there's like a couple main things to kind of think about. So a lot of times visualizations have a what Donna Haraway, the feminist theorist, very well known, wrote, writing from the 1980s onward, what Donna Haraway would call a view from nowhere. And so that's in terms of just very specifically speaking about, like the kind of default view of visualizations is that they are a view from a disembodied perspective and this is part of their power. So I want to make that really clear. One of the reasons we love data visualizations is because they are like the view from above. It's kind of like when you're flying in the plane and you see the landscape below and you're like, I can see it all right. It's amazing. And so that's why they're dazzling in the same way maps. Maps are like this as well, right? Where it's like, oh, I see the whole thing right now. And so there's something very seductive about that. And I think we need to acknowledge the seductiveness of it. And that also can be something that you work with and intentionally sort of manipulate as material, but then also thinking about how it sort of removed the perspective from a body and really kind of positioned it as, like a God's eye view of the world. And so that's where, like, a strong claim of feminist thought would be around situated knowledge. This idea that knowledge is situated, I think it's Johanna Drucker says, knowledge is partial, knowledge is situated, and knowledge is historical. And so what that means is knowledge comes from human bodies. It's partial in the sense that no one of us ever truly has that God's eye view, even though we love to imagine that we could through our dashboards and all of our things. And so, in some sense, and this is sort of like where Mushon Zer-Aviv work goes as well, in some sense, like, data visualizations sort of lie a little bit, like this premise that we are seeing the whole picture. Like, what they seem to communicate is clarity, insight. You're seeing the whole picture when, in fact, there's a little bit of a sleight of hand going on. Because, of course, that the truth that they present is partial.",

And so a lot of, like, I would say what feminist did at visualization would try to do would be to untangle that and show the ways that it's not neutral. But then also think about, like, what, what strategies might we use in the visualization itself to also communicate that as well? And so I think there's various strategies one could use and design strategies that you can make use of, and we start to try to outline some of those. But then, on the other hand, so there's that. So there's a kind of, what I would call the kind of perspective from the epistemology of data visualization. There's an epistemological critique. There's. But then, on the other side of it, feminist thought also pays close attention to how things get made and to labor. So there's a whole history of feminist scholarship looking at how, for many years, work done in the home like care, work and reproductive labor. It's all very sort of undervalued. It's invisible. It doesn't rise to the surface. It's not remunerated. And so in this sense, too, we felt obligated to look kind of at the whole process of the data visualization and then also to look at literally just like, who are the people producing the data visualizations as well. And so this is then like the perspective you get to of, like, who's included, who's making data visualizations, who's framing the research questions, who's designing the things. And so I think there's also these kind of issues of diversity and inclusion and equity in just the nuts and bolts of actually making the things as well. And so that's a whole place where there's whole populations missing from that world. So, yeah, I don't know if that really answers the question.",

And I think that goes in a very similar direction in a sense that she talks about, like the. Yeah, like not making that mistake of thinking just because something is quantified, it's like objective or has no real haptics to it anymore. And she tries to bring back also this like, notion of an explicit author and carer and so on. I think that's sort of interesting.

And I think the really amazing history that he has sort of written of data visualization. I mean, kind of made this thing happen in, like, the eighties, you know, where it wasn't happening. But at the same time, it's a very sort of, like, modernist viewpoint. It's also like this viewpoint of missing the fact that data visualizations are communication objects. And so in the same way that, like, a photograph isn't neutral, and we now understand that, like, especially with the age of Photoshop and where everybody's taking so many pictures and everybody has access to doing filters on Instagram and things like this, I think there's widespread literacy about how photos are not neutral. They're not these one to one representations of the world. That's just, it's just not how they function. There's framing. There's a kind of communicative act that goes into the shooting of the photo, the framing of the photo, the processing of the photo, the deploying of the photo out into the world. That's something that I think we're just starting to talk about in data visualization, how it's a, it is a rhetorical act, no matter how neutral or scientific you might think that it is, it is a communicative act. And so, like, even when you think it's, like, the most neutral, I mean, I think my co author of the book, Lauren Klein, and I would claim that it's actually the least objective because what it's communicating is neutrality. And that has so much power, you know, so you cannot avoid communicating. And so, like, even when you think that you're communicating neutrality, you're actually communicating all of these other things. So, yeah, so I think so. So, yeah, I would say, like, we're moving out of a modernist phase of data visualization. And it's, but it's getting very interesting. And I think that that's what's kind of exciting. And then even some of the research from the more scientific side, from the information visualization community specifically, is upholding some of these things as well. So I'm thinking of the research of Michelle Borkin and folks like this who are showing that, well, actually, when visualizations are novel, people remember them more.

And I've been reading lots of scientific stuff and I like to think that there is one proper way of doing things and there is a bad way of doing things, right.

It's like, oh, okay, well, if everything is persuasive, then you go into total relativism and some of the feminist theory and some of the deconstructionist theory from postmodernism type of era goes there. And that is not, I think that's actually super unhelpful. And it leaves us in a position of never being able to do anything except maybe write down music. And, I mean, this is actually kind of the project. This is kind of like why I think Lauren and I wanted to try to connect feminist theory to data visualization, something that is like a practice, and also, in particular, to data visualization that aspires to do good in the world. So, like, the public data visualizations, like in data journalism or the arts or in the nonprofit sector or libraries, is precisely like, people need to move forward. And so I think a lot of the ending point of theory is just like, oh, you made these theories, and you've deconstructed everything, and you've left us with nothing in return. And those are not usually helpful starting points for moving forward. So I think everything is relative, is not the. I mean, it's also not like where the feminist theorists that we're drawing on, at least like Donna Haraway and Sandra Harding and folks like this would say that this does not mean that there's no truth, you know? And actually, in Donna Haraway's essay, where she coins this term, the God trick, where she's talking about that, like, view from nowhere, in that same essay, she's talking about something she calls feminist objectivity, which is this idea that we are limited and we are, by just necessity, limit. We are partial humans. Like, I will never be a man. I will never be a different race. I will never be born in Bangalore versus Boston. I have these things that are part of my history and my identity that I've experienced that I cannot change. And they shape how I view the world. They shape the kinds of questions that I ask, and it's always going to be that way. But at the same time, this doesn't preclude us from being as objective as possible and knowing that we have those kinds of biases, but then also combining that with other situated perspectives. And this is why there's also a real emphasis in feminist theory on collaboration as well, and collaboration and plurality. And so that's one of the things we actually put in our paper. I think that's. What is it? I think we said embracing pluralism is a design principle. And so that would come out of this idea that though we are limited and partial in our knowledge, by pairing with others and learning what they learn and having them point out to us some of our blind spots, this is how we can move forward. I would never say that all knowledge is relative. I think all of these fields are these set of emerging practices, and we argue over them, and ultimately, hopefully, we get somewhere that are good and practical. Places, or we have people who come in and point out our own blind spots.",

And we also like, what we've been starting to look into and talk about as well is, like, how you involve multiple voices throughout the whole process. So not even just in the making of the visualization, but also in the, I mean, even in the selecting of the research question, even in the analysis. Like, there's actually, I've been trying to track a lot of projects. They mainly seem to be happening more in either kind of community based art and the arts, or they're happening through public engagement processes with the city. But there's some really interesting projects that are going on where they involve members of the public or like, sort of non experts in analysis of the data. So sort of not the visualization necessarily, but in sort of going through a public conversation and dialogue about, like, what does this data mean? And so I think those are all super interesting and exciting. And again, a way to sort of undermine this idea of, like, if you work with data, you're this, you're the wizard or you're the unicorn or something like that.

      "text": "Sure. Yeah. I mean, maybe one that I'll talk about, which I think is instructive, particularly because I think particularly for people who are making data visualizations now in a variety of different contexts. Context. One of the principles is consider context. And what we mean by that is. So there's this complicated situation right now in which we have all these data sets that are being released into the world. We have the open data movement. We have APIs that one can contact and download data from them. So we have a situation where there would appear to be this environment of plenty, in a sense, for. For data that one can gather. But what happens a lot, and I'm sure you all are familiar with this, is that when you download these data sets from the web, in my classes, for example, we work with lots of open data from cities and states and countries and stuff. The context has been completely stripped. So there's very bad metadata, and it's often very unclear where does this data fit. So why was this data collected? How does it fit within the organizational context in which it exists? How does it unfold? Just even, what are the column names mean? Often there's no data dictionary or whatever. And so that's one where it's like you're particularly ripe for making even just basic errors. You're literally just, like, wrong about what does this data represent? And it's, again, where like, a little bit of backtracking. So looking back, I actually have my students do things like write data biographies where they download data, but then they go back in the process and be like, yeah, that's a great idea. Where does this thing come from? And paint a little bit of a picture of it. Yeah.",

It doesn't preclude us doing something with it, but it does mean just be a little more careful when you are doing things with it. So I think that's fascinating. And it's like every sort of data point in a spreadsheet is that story. It's like somebody scribbled a number on a form and somebody else translated that number into some database, and then somebody else used it to do this particular analysis in this way. So there's this history that is there that's not always immediately apparent. And so that's what this consider context thing means, is how do we sort of understand that our current data environment, especially sort of downloading data from the web and stuff like that, is really not ideal. There's a lot that is lacking both in terms of accessibility and then context and metadata. And so how do we kind of trace that back and understand before we jump in and just kind of move into the future and make some nice chart or graph? How do we understand? Sort of like, where that comes from? And so I actually have my students do interviews with people and things like this. And so that's also just a way, I think, just to do better data visualization and just not to make really bad mistakes. And there are cases of where journalists have made sort of embarrassing mistakes because they think the data is one thing, but then actually it's some wholly other thing that they're representing.",

And this idea that the data doesn't speak for itself. So just because you get a spreadsheet doesn't mean it's true. Right. And so they did this project on sexual assault on college campuses, and they collected all the data and they were looking just at Massachusetts, and then they found this very weird thing where, like, the schools that had the least amount of sexual assault cases were actually the places that had the least supportive environment for survivors to come forward.

And so on paper, like, if you were just like, oh, the data is gonna speak for itself, you would have said something like, oh, oh, Williams College is doing really bad, and they have all of these cases of sexual assault. And that would have been like, if you're just like, whipping it up, that would be your bar chart or whatever. But when, in fact, when they, like, did interviews and they talked to people and they learned more about the data and how it's reported. So it's reported through, it's a national database. It's called the Clery report and the institution's self report. So there's many incentives for institutions to, you know, no institution wants to look like it has high levels of sexual assault. And then, of course, with actual survivors, there's strong incentives not to come forward, especially in a hostile environment where they wouldn't be supported. And so that was their ultimate conclusion, is that actually the data was the inverse of the truth. And the places that look the worst actually have this very supportive environment. They have staff, time and resources devoted to the issue. They have support groups. And so this is a very interesting finding and where, again, if you don't understand the context, you're both going to get it wrong. But also, there are some sort of, there are, like, gender and identity issues that go on here as well, because often the voices that are the most silenced are those voices of, say, women, marginalized groups, minorities and others who are not necessarily comfortable coming forward in a particular kind of climate.

Called Big Bang data, but, yeah. So my artist friend Andy Sutton and I, we did a collaborative piece where we notice, and we now have a map, actually, that we're going to publish, but that the coastline of Boston in 1788, basically, before it was all filled in, it's a very human made landscape. The coastline from 1788 is very, very similar to the coastline projected for 2100. And so there's this alignment. It's scary, actually, because the sea level rise is predicted to be so high in Boston, both due to climate change and to some erosion as well, that we thought, well, this is a really interesting opportunity to talk about this. The fact that we're returning. When we go into the future, we're returning to this past view of what Boston was like. And so we basically led a tour. So we walked part of the future and the past coastline at a place where they overlap with each other. And we had a little what we called micro lectures along the way. So we had, like, the head of the environment for the city of Boston spoke about landscape design and zoning codes and how we need to adjust zoning codes to deal with climate change. We had a woman from the Boston Harbor association who's done some of the most forefront modeling and data collection on the sea level rise. So she spoke about that process. And then we had a media scholar talk about coastlines, sort of in the cultural imagination as well. And then we ended by all stenciling messages on the Boston common in this sort of participatory art project. So our goal was, like, to bring the data to the level of the body. So, again, this kind of emphasis on embodiment and situating it in the body and having people feel like we're walking this line where literally there's nowhere where you can see the river or the ocean or anything like that and feel like, oh, this is gonna be underwater. Like, this is where the water line will be in the future. And there's something very visceral about that. That as opposed to when you just kind of see it in that top down view, where you see it in the situated view. So, yeah, so that was our walking data visualization.",
