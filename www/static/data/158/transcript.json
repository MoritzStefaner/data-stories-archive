Well, actually, there's been a huge blind spot. So Enrico and I, whenever we review our Trello board with episode ideas, we realize sometimes, oh, we've done so many episodes, but we never talked to somebody from Fieldx or from, you know, this and that area. And it's been like this, really for years. Small to medium data visualization agencies, which is insane because some of the best database work obviously comes from these types of companies. And we talk to a lot of practitioners and researchers and whatnot, but never really to people running data visualization studios. Huge blind spot happens. But now we're catching up quick. And so we're inviting two event guests today, and we record another episode with two more guests, and this will be the next one. So hopefully we're back to a good ratio of database agency folks after all this and keep going. And I'm personally super interested. I have known the folks who will talk for you for many, many years. In fact, I realized last year at encode conference that a lot of these agencies have been around for ten years or longer. And so it's really now fascinating to hear a bit of their long term perspective on how the field has evolved, how the field has changed, if there is even a viable business and making high end crafted data visualization, or if we will all be unemployed soon. So I'm super curious to learn more about all this. So, as I said, we have two guests. The first one is Thomas clever. Hi, Thomas.",

And I think also that's how I stumbled over Enrico's work. And then sort of like a year later, I co founded Interactive Things, which, fairly similar to Clever Franke, is a design and development studio with a focus on data driven products. We are a team of 17 people. We're sort of like a slightly weird beast as we are five equal partners in the company. Yeah. And I think today, sort of like, my main focus is leading the company.

So I think the project that sort of, like, comes to mind is actually two projects, and that's education inequalities and education progress. So these are two websites that we have built for UNESCO, and they are sister products in a way, even though they're seven years apart. So education inequalities is already seven years old now, and education progress was just released. The first was an exploratory tool analyzing disparities in quality of education, and the second is then an explanatory publication summarizing the key facts and trends. And so in a way, they present two sides of the data visualization coin. So, like exploration for discovery and explanation for understanding. And besides being interesting from a data visualization perspective, I think the projects also rank very high in sort of like our, in our view, because of the purpose they both advance to sustainable development. Goal four forward, which I think is an important aspect, so inclusive and equitable quality of education for all. The second is the client. UNESCO has been a long term and very, very committed client to the success of each of their project. And then in terms of craft, we're both challenged in design and development when we work on these projects. And typically with UNESCO, we are allowed to pursue a very iterative process instead of sort of like fixed scope, waterfall type of process. And I think these three aspects, or four aspects, purpose, client, craft and process, are important to us, and I think they are well reflected in those two projects.",

And I think if you look back over the years that we've been running the business, there's always some quintessential projects, some lighthouse projects that I think really define you as a company to take a next step in where you are. If I have to choose, then I think the Mobility index website that we created for the Chicago Metropolitan Agency of planning is one of my personal favorites, really, because it brings together a lot of things dear to my heart and dear to our company's heart, in the sense that it's a mix of experimental data vis with an important message behind it. The CMAP approached us because they had written a new mobility plan, or a new urban planning plan, so to speak, for the city of Chicago, which was pretty much the first comprehensive urban planning plan since Danyel Burnham, which was about 100 years ago. And it really outlined around economy, mobility and livability, where the city should be heading, and also the challenges that they face. So mobility is a very important topic to the city of Chicago. I think 25% of the workforce is somehow tied to freight transportation, all those types of things. And the investment that needs to be done in the infrastructure there is about $13 trillion. And to really convey that message, they asked us, can you concise or can you digest this plan of 660 pages into one interactive website? And of course, we said yes. Remembering that on the way there on the plane, I was reading through that plan and thinking, I'm not sure how we're going to do it, but it was really a really nice project in how we did a lot of editorial stuff on understanding the plan and thinking, how can we explain this plan to anybody down in the street, but also to business policymakers, journalists, politicians? And there's a whole editorial sort of structure that there's a bird's eye view over Chicago. And then as you dive into the topics, you literally dive down into street level. There's different types of visualizations from charts to. We were using new technologies at the time. This was 2014. So, yeah, a lot of boxes that are ticked in that project. And I think, you know, looking back, I just realized when I heard Ben talk that that was the first time that we set foot in Chicago. And here we are six, seven years later. International map right here we have the office in Chicago. So really it's also the moment in time I fell in love with that city.",

So of course we did some internships but never worked at a company. We've always been our own boss. So I have to admit, that is a side note I should make. But if I look at other design agencies, other web agencies, those type of companies, and of course, people that have joined us over the years, I think there are, you know, we might be 90, 95% the same. I think in terms of, you know, the complexity of the work is where, where. I think it is a little bit different. And I'm not saying one is better than the other, don't get me wrong. But I think when you look at the type of clients and the type of challenges that they throw at us, it's very much at the intersection of data strategy and business. And business can also be an organization like a UNESCO, like Ben mentioned. But there are goals there, and these are all sort of, we're trying to marry those and really understand what is this business? What is the core of their challenge? And once we get to that core, either through data or with data, that's when you build up the product and start thinking about the users, the stakeholders, and all those type of things. So there's a delicate balance in the projects that we work on from a business perspective. Then, of course, there's the data, which is we use data the way that another design agency might use photography or music or film or cinematography. But data has, of course, some inherent challenges with it as well. Data quality, privacy. Go on. There's multiple podcasts in that. But I think really, that complexity is what you really have to digest and understand. And both from a technical and a design perspective, do you often feel you.",

But other than that, yeah, there's a lot of focus in our work on just understanding the challenge, the landscape that this has to work in, has to operate in. And also, I think, you know, looking at the design and technology people that work in our company, I think we attract different type of designers and technologists than, let's say, you would at an ad agency. I mean, you're not going to see our work out in the open in like, this train station per se on big billboards. Right. It's very often a different type of project. So, yeah.

      "text": "No, I mean, I share on the one hand side, I share the same caveat. I've never worked in another design agencies and therefore, sort of, like, don't really have the inside scoop there. And I agree with the things that you've mentioned of the complexity of working in sort of like, on data intensive products and also the nonlinearity of sort of like, the development process. There simply isn't really a chance of, you know, conceptual work, design work, development work, what you would typically, or what you would have traditionally found in application development or sort of like, website development. So the notion of a cross functional team having to continually and iteratively working together, I think just is an inherent part of how such a data design agency works. There is a, or I mean, that's also something that we had to learn. There is simply no other way. And similarly, to the point that sort of like Moritz mentioned, educating the client on how this work happens, the idea of sort of like dropping a CSV file on our doorstep and expecting an award winning experience of like six weeks after to be picked up is something that like, might still exist in fantasies, but it's just not part of the reality. And so also understanding that this sort of intensive work and nonlinear work involves many different stakeholders, and that's the data provider, that's the product owner, these are the end users, these are the domain experts. And so it is definitely, working as a client with an agency is definitely more hands on than they might typically expect from working with a web design agency, or a branding agency or a marketing agency. And I don't want to, again, sort of like, I don't have the insights goop into these, how these agencies function. Maybe they're exactly the same level of sort of like hands on knees, deep in the client's materials. And for them it's just videos or textual content or imagery. And for us it's just their sort of like raw data. And that might be the case. Right. But that, I think, is something that might be a misunderstanding of input data and output visually, like output data driven experience. And that's just not sort of like a hands off situation.",

And data has rights to, and interests and preferences maybe, or affordances.

And I was wondering, what's your experience with scaling data visualization productions? Like, can you scale it? Is it easy to separate the work so you can work with five people on one data visualization product, or even with ten? Or is there like a natural limit where this tight collaboration between data and design and technology and consulting breaks down? Did you find maybe a formula that makes it easier to, to divide the work and have really clearly defined interfaces? Or do you have a lot of small teams that all do little projects?

But I think looking at an ideal team setup for us, I think you're looking at around six to eight people on a larger project. That's when going above those numbers, people start to get in each other's way. And at the same time, that's sort of the number that our team really collaborates with each other. So it really is an important collaboration. Of course, there are smaller projects that maybe one or two people might work on, but if you look at the scaling and the larger projects, that's for us, an ideal size. And often, I think a lot of our clients are surprised. They would even say that our team is small on a project, because very often big IT firms are working with 20, 30, 40 people on something, and here we come in with eight, and they sort of look at you and think, are you sure you can manage? But really, it's about efficiency and just having a team that trusts each other and knows exactly where each other's skillset lies. So, yeah, I think that is the optimum size, and that's, I guess, two, three, four type projects that you have at the same time in the studio.

So I think we consider more of like, four to a maximum of six people to work well for us, maybe also to work well for the type of products that we're producing. I think, of course, depending on for who you work, what the product needs to look like, and how quickly it has to be delivered, those are all factors that define the project team. But in general, we form these project teams that are then dedicated to working on an individual product. They are typically cross functional. So it's designers with a variety of skills, its developers has a variety of skills working together. We try our best to keep those cross functional teams altogether, from start through execution to the end. There's always work to do for everyone, which is a slight shift from how we thought work would happen at the beginning. So over time, like that is definitely one of the learnings and something that we try to make our principal way of working in this type of project. And as a result, scaling up, I could see scaling up, working like self organized teams. So I don't think that it makes sense to scale up, at least for the type of projects that we do, to scale up the teams to double or triple the size that I just mentioned. That doesn't necessarily mean that an agency of clever Frankie size, for example, doesn't work in my perspective. You mentioned it. You're a little bit beyond 30 people. So I could see that scaling, and then you have a higher throughput of projects, but the individual project, team size per project is roughly the same. And I think if you look towards the principle of self organized teams and self organized organizations like teal and all of these buzzwords, then I think that's also reflected in their thinking. Like, don't try to instantiate too big of a division of labor, don't build up silos, and then don't try to centralize functions or don't have too many centralized functions. Instead embed those into the individual teams. And then an organization should be fairly flexible in scaling or contracting. But again, that's just theory. I don't really have practical experience with that. I'm not sure that I'm interested in earning that. But the area of self organization in teams is definitely something that I think is interesting. And on this very small scale here at interactive things, that's something that we try to pursue.",

These are people who are making, building, creating things. They're building products. And yes, for some the tools is JavaScript. For some the tools is go. For some the tools is python. For others the tools is sketch. And for yet others the tool is Tableau. Yes, the tools change. And I mean, it could be said that sort of like a designer's mindset is slightly different from sort of like a programmer's mindset. But at the end of the day, sort of like, we're confronted with a series of challenges. There are methods that we apply to overcome these challenges and sort of like find the solutions to problems. And at the end of the day, we sort of like see a progression in. At the beginning there was nothing, and at the end there's going to be a product and sort like, you just continually evolve this thing until it's done or good enough or award winning. And if you assemble a team that I think believes in each other's responsibilities and also believes in each other's strengths, then it doesn't necessarily matter if they consider themselves to be a designer or an engineer or a hybrid somewhere in between. And to me, that is always one of the most important aspects in our hiring. One of the big areas that we want to explore with a potential hire is what their perspective on collaboration, communication and community is to learn how they see themselves. I think maybe I'm in the privileged position to make a pick and therefore have people on our team that, where I don't even have this conflict of that person, doesn't really go well with a very creative, very experimental designer. So of course there's a curation. So I have this slight distorted view. If I just took a general population of designers and developers, then yes, the curation would have to happen on a per project basis. But in the lucky situation of having a steady team, I don't have to make this curation. And we sort of establish a common understanding and a common respect between all the people as a fundament.

And of course there are discussions within the studio between designers, programmers, developers, but also among designers themselves and developers themselves. I mean, in the end, our team is passionate and a lot of passionate individuals. So, you know, there's also discussions going on between interaction designers and visual designers about the styling of a button, whether it's ugly or not. And it is fundamental discussions like that that go on. And at the same time, like Ben said, I think a lot of people that work in our types of companies and in Dataviz are often this hybrid or multi skilled individuals that have this interest in technology and design. So very often I joke that we have the design nerds and the nerd designers in our company, and really we hire on culture, on cultural fit more than talent and skill set, because I'm a firm believer on educating people on certain things. Of course, you need to have some fundamental form of talent for either design or code, but a lot of things you can learn on the job, and we train people in that, but things that you can't learn are just having trust in your colleagues, working together. And really, one of the fundamental questions I ask in any job interview to myself is, could I sit next to this person in an airplane for 4 hours? And 4 hours is just long enough to start getting sweaty and annoyed and uncomfortable. And are you happy with the person sitting next to you at that moment in time? Are you going to have a good conversation? And it's a very good test for yourself to think about, does this person fit into our company? And that doesn't mean that people have to be the same. On the contrary, I want to have as many different people in our company working together. But there needs to be this fundamental respect and trust for each other and for each other's capabilities, whether you're junior or senior, all these things.

So that's where I see the long term view for us is really those adaptive interfaces and systems that are much larger than just a single visualization. And also, I think, maybe even going as far as questioning whether we should visualize data in future, whether we should actually be helping people in such a way that they don't need to look at data, which is, I think, an interesting philosophical question that we have discussions about quite often in our studios.

So even understanding the value of using data in more aspects than analytics, data prone fields that have been working with data for decades before. And instead, I think that's reflective. When Thomas said, as we have seen new data sets, like maybe things were analytics sets before, and then financial sets, because these are traditional industries that have been working with data for a long time. But now we see consumers working with data much more. We see journalists working with data much more. We see educators working with data, people who have to report on their data, switching from interpretations in written form to more exploratory experience. So I think all this new data that we get to work with is a result of more diverse people working actively with data and don't necessarily do all the interpretation and transmission into the spoken word again, but instead allow their stakeholders to actively still explore and experiment with the data.

This is like everybody's understanding in almost all industries. And so it's much less of this explanation of what type of work this is and why this is important and what can be the benefits. We start much later, sort of like in this education process, whenever we talk to clients. And I think that will definitely continue to shift. I think we have, again, like, there's a mass market for data visualizations now, but I think that also poses the next challenges, because I think we also have reached a certain level of the audience that definitely now have a much higher data literacy or data visualization literacy, but there's still much more ground to be covered. And maybe, as Thomas says, maybe visualization is not necessarily the right medium anymore. So if we look at trends, like, I want answers instead of I want to analyze, I won't have something personalized instead of I want to have something generic. I want to have something that's quick, snackable, and consumable instead of sort of like, this long form. So these shifts in consumer behavior and how we consume information in general, I think point in the direction of where work, sort of like, of where I think human data interaction will go. And the visual media is extremely powerful. It is also exclusive. So it also exclusively excludes people with certain disabilities to even start Interactive [Things] with data. And so I think, not as a fallback, but instead of taking the human data as the actual norm and then thinking, is visualization the right medium, or is yet another type of medium more adequate?

So finally we had the space and we felt, let's build this prototyping lab where we can just go wild on anything. But like most things in life, that stands idle for 90, 95% of the time. So that's a shame. You know, like owning a car, you don't use it very often if you think about it. So that's why we said, hey, why don't we consolidate that into what we call Sensorlab and open it up for students and people that want to come use our equipment and use our tools. And hopefully the odd intern or the odd employee walks out at the same time, or walks in, I should say, and then walks out as an employee. So that's really what sensor lab is about. It's not a different company or anything, but it's something that we promote separately and it's a little bit bigger than just the prototyping lab. We also have an event space in our office that we host presentations and those type of things. So we have university students coming in and learning about data visualization. We have created this workshop that is a very small introductory workshop, three to 4 hours for students to learn how to connect a muscle sensor to an interface and get the data in a JSON file and how to structure it and then create their own visualizations out of it. So really it's fun and games, so to speak, but in a structured way that makes business sense in some way, shape or form.",

And, you know, not having the experience of working in another agency like you, there are always things that you want to learn from each other and see how you deal with challenges. So you mentioned that, you know, you work with these multi skilled teams, four to six people, and you run into this during a datavis process. You switch from analysis to design to development to narrator, back to analysis to find the best angle and way forward to bring this message across. How do you switch perspectives at the right time within your team? And I asked that because that's a constant challenge on our end, always.",

      "text": "Yeah, that's a fantastic question. And I think that applies to both interdisciplinary teams, but that also applies to an individual who would just sort of execute a project from start to finish on their own, because you do have to put on different hats or sort of put on different glasses to have a different perspective and focus on what's relevant at that time. So, I mean, one sort of tool that helped us set this mindset, depending on the project phase, is something that we sort of, like, started a few years ago. We have in our office, for each project, we have project boards very similar to how other companies work with kanban boards or a similar system. And on our project boards, we have sort of like a few different templates for different stages that the project is in. And besides having things like a timeline and a list of requirements or a list of assumptions and then sort of like a kanban board for our tools, we also have a big sheet where we have our mindset written on it. So in sort of like, written out English, we write, what is our current mindset that we operate under in this phase of the project? And that sort of evolves over time. And so in a way, it acts as a token, it acts as a reminder. It takes the. Yeah, it, again, sort of. It's something that you can point to. It's something that you, because you have it in daily stand up meetings or also in larger discussions that you can sort of, like, point to and say, hey, let's not forget that we try to explore different options. So it's not necessarily the point in time to sort of cut out everything that's bad and only pursue one direction. Or conversely, hey, now is not the time for more exploration. Now is refinement and polishing. And so these things written out in physical space, if you work in a physical space or written out in a digital space for a team, is a very helpful token for not forgetting it as the project leader yourself, but also having everybody be able to point to it and then actually actively using it in discussions and in their work. So that's something that helped us.",

Peter Gassner, one of the partners at Interactive [Things], he wrote a lengthy blog post about the thinking behind it. It has been a few years in the making until we're where we are and it's an evolving thing. So these things change. And right now we're trying to move away also in the current situation, trying to move away from the physical necessity to have the board in the room have an equivalent in the digital space that is a little bit more portable and sort of like allows for a little bit more remote access.

All these physical things that you can point to and discuss together can be so valuable and building up that mutual and this common ground between people. Yeah, we're doing the same thing here and this is where we are. It sounds trivial, but it's very important. Yeah. Wonderful. That was great chatting to you.
