And then they will mix that muesli and send it to you. And now they had their fifth year anniversary and so they said it would be interesting just to work a bit with the. The data of what was ordered. And initially we also thought about, like, who ordered it. Like, where did people come from? You know, where people who ordered papaya, you know, do they have an interesting distribution in Germany or not? Or how about cities versus the countryside and so on? Yeah, but, yeah, that went a bit too far. But what I looked at is, and that's fairly interesting also, is which ingredients were ordered together a lot, you know, so you have like 50, 60 ingredients or so. And of course, it's very interesting of what, you know, to find out what people combine and what they don't tend to combine. And so I made a few network visualizations around that.",

And that helps a lot in just people getting a sense to immediately think about the data, you know, does it make sense? Would I have combined that the same way? You know, and so everybody has a good intuition of. Yeah, if the data makes sense or the data presentation makes sense because they have a strong grip on the. On the underlying. Yeah. Or their own opinion of what belongs together or not. Yeah, yeah. And it was a quite interesting project. So first I thought it's fairly straightforward and the insights won't be that great. You know, that was my expectation. But in fact, there were many little combinations I didn't really foresee. And so there was, in fact, a lot to learn about the data set. And it was also interesting because I produced a few different views. So the final solution was a radial view with curved lines, bend lines, and it's grouped by the sort of ingredient type. So nuts, fruits, cereals, and so on. And inside each group, I put the most popular into the center. So you have a fairly good categorization of the notes. So that's really helpful. And then I'm also drawing the lines depending on the two colors of the. So each group also has a color sort of assigned, and the lines are drawn with a gradient connecting these two colors, more or less. And the interesting thing is, this was the most popular with the client, and I think it's also the strongest one for the purpose they had in mind, because they wanted to have it in their catalog and maybe print a poster or something like this. And it's one that is immediately readable. And many people can relate to it. And the circles, you can bash them a lot, you know, and I'm a bit tired of them. But they are really also very space effective, you have to say that. So there was no other visualization where you could like, arrange these. I don't know how many were like 50, 60 different labels and they were all readable, you know?",

If you're really interested in the actual, like, labels, you know, and not just in the structure of the network, but the actual, let's say, content, then the radial visualization often has like a big, big advantage. Yeah, it's very space efficient. So anyways, what was interesting here is that it, although it works really well, I think some really strong links are totally neglected in this view because they're between neighbor neighboring nodes. And that's a huge, you know, the big problem is also if you put like lines on a map, you know, for trade or something like this, the long lines always attract the attention.",

They're just the longest lines. And, you know, it can happen that a very unimportant line, it's just long because the two nodes are positioned that way. And so the strongest link in the network was exactly between raspberry and strawberries. And these were the most, two most popular fruit. And so they were next to each other and they have this very little line connecting them. When I saw that, I did a few other views, and the most successful one from the readability point of view, was to make a matrix, actually, like have your ingredients in rows and columns and then have a circle for each connection strength, sort of. And. Yeah, but that didn't look as tasty to the client and to me as well, I have to admit. It looks a bit more rotten. And of course, you cannot really. And at that point, I realized I should not have just worked with how often something is combined, but work much more on that probability level. So I did one variation of that matrix where I would highlight the connections that are, let's say, unexpectedly high given the individual popularities of the ingredients. And then I thought this is the direction I should have gone. Like, how strong, how does the appearance of one ingredient influence the probabilities that other ingredients appear?

And so his lab, they did a study on basically on two things. So at the one hand, they looked at how different ingredients appear together in recipes. So that's a smart move. You know, you can parse a recipe for ingredient names. So they took basically a couple of cookbooks and look, you know, which ingredients were combined and then they were doing that across cultures. So they could see if, let's say, in African cuisine or in Asian cuisine, there are different flavor combinations. I mean, obviously. But which ones they are. Exactly. And then they also look there is in cooking. There is a sort of this food pairing hypothesis that ingredients that share chemical compounds, or that there are certain compounds that if an ingredient. If two ingredients share them. I'm sorry, have to be precise here, that they then go well together. So that there's a chemical, you know, simple chemical rule for if two ingredients go together well or not. So there's a whole theory behind food pairing. It's called pairing ingredients. And they wanted to investigate how well this chemical hypothesis more or less matches the empirical data from recipes. And it's a fantastic study. And what they found out is that the western cuisine seems to use that food pairing principle based on the chemistry. But, for instance, east Asian cuisine tends to avoid even.",

So you can paint with food, so you have all the 2d things, you know, you can make sculptures, so you have all the 3d information, and then on top of that, you have flavor. You have, like, cooking times. You have, you have the whole semiotic aspects of food. You know, what a potato means in Ireland, you know, or, you know, all that is associated with food like caviar and lobster. And I don't know. Every food ingredient has a meaning in, in a way, and they are so cool. If you think about it, it would be the most expressive medium for data visualization overall. No, really, I'm serious.

I think it's, I don't remember how many entries, but it's really, really, really large and really high dimensional. I don't remember how many dimensions you have there, but it's really, really large. So let me see if I can find it in a moment. I have the link here. Yeah, I mean there is a nice query tool on the web, but you can also download directly the old data set. And then for every food you have something like the amount of water, energy, protein, lipid, carbohydrate and so on, high level measurements, and then you have very specific measurements like minerals, and for every mineral, the amount of mineral that you find there, and for every vitamin the same, you have something like ten or 15 vitamins or lipids and so on. It's really, really rich. And yeah, a few times during my research activity, I tried to use this data set for our own purposes and it's really fascinating what you can find there. Unfortunately, I never had time to come up with a visualization whose purpose was exactly to show the content of this database, but I think that's a very nice challenge.

How is it called? How fulfilling a food is? Okay, so probably you want to optimize your food and take everything that is on the top, right, which is very nutritious and very fulfilling.
