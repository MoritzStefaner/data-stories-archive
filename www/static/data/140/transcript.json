You know, we had a conversation on data stories, talking about how the experience of data visualization professionals was a bit different from the experience of freelancers and journalists. And I think that the reason why we were having a conversation, why these conversations have been happening, is because there's less and less distinction between the different fields. I would argue there's less and less distinction between the different tools and there's less and less distinction between the different audiences. And so that conversation ties into these conversations that have been ongoing about critical discourse and whether or not how to give and take criticism properly, accessibility and research, and just general themes that are about sort of broader, holistic view of data visualization that's not focused on certain tool defined communities or audience defined communities. And so I sort of offered up in that third wave data visualization talk that I gave at Tapestry this idea that we needed to formalize this and build up some kind of resources to support people who were in the field and especially people who were getting into the field. And then after that talk, I got tracked down by Amy and Molly and we sort of started talking about this at the time there. And it was, you know, one of these, you know how these conversations are at a conference where you're like, oh, my God, this is a great idea. We should change the entire world.

That's beyond Twitter, that's long term, that's more conversational, that's less hierarchical, where people can easily connect with each other and share projects and resources, no matter how, quote unquote, dataviz famous they are. Someone with ten Twitter followers might get very little response if they posted a cool project they've done on Twitter. But if you can post it in the share channel in Dataviz society, it'll get attention. If it's awesome, because it's awesome, not because you're well known or you have followers. So that was one thing that we think was a value add that people get a lot out of, and then another thing, which was kind of a simpler thing, was, yeah, there are already so many kind of resources out there, but when someone's first starting out, like, when I first started out, I didn't know where to find this stuff. I didn't know where to go. I didn't know what conferences there were and, or I didn't even know that there was a date of his jobs board till earlier this year. And that was thanks to Amy.

And what we saw when we opened up the slack was that somebody would ask a question and some guy named Alberto would answer. Some guy named Moritz would answer. You know, Enrico, you were right in there with people. I had felt the same thing that you did more with people who I hadn't heard of, who were doing amazing work, and everybody was just right there. So I feel like to a certain degree, we were constrained by the methods that we had to communicate with each other because they had with them, they sort of smuggled with them these bad qualities that the community actually didn't reflect.

We have a website that we're continuing to put information up. We have a medium publication which distills a lot of stuff from the slack and also other voices. We have an email newsletter, which is coming out more regularly so people can get information pushed to them that way. It's not just this conversational slack, although that's a big part of it. So it's organized. The three of us are sort of the core heart drive behind this thing right now, but we also have a large group of volunteers who we call facilitators that are helping us push this thing forward and make decisions for slack. There's two moderators for every channel. They help keep an eye on things, and that has been huge. It's another set of eyes, more enthusiasm to keep discussions going.

      "text": "So one of the things that goes on, one of the fears I think that folks had when they first started out was they saw this slack and they saw the enormous number of people there and just how fast it was moving to. And we all heard the same thing from the beginning. Everybody noticed it because Slack puts it in front of your face as soon as it happens. Once you get over 10,000 messages, then you have to pay some absurd licensing fee to slack to get access to older messages early on. Anybody who's had experience with slack, like I have with a large slack community, like the D3 J's, slack, knew that that was coming. And so what we wanted to do was for two reasons. One, to sort of keep a memory of conversations. We wanted to make sure to prompt folks to try to write things and distill the thoughts that were going on. But also the conversations are great, and a lot of material shows up in them that are great. But I'm still a firm believer that in that process of writing and distilling, then you actually identify value in those conversations and insights that are going to be useful for the whole community. So we never wanted this to be sort of an enclosed space that only a person who signed up could take part in. We wanted to have something that allowed us to express whatever learnings were discovered there, but also to elevate voices of these early career professionals, to allow them the chance to write about these things and somehow draw a through line between the points that folks were making. And I think that that's been working out amazingly well. I'm kind of shocked at just how many medium pieces, how many essays we've managed to put together. And it's only been two months. That's the other thing that kind of strikes me. I feel like it's been a long time. Sometimes it feels like it's been too long, that data visualization society has been around, and it's literally only been two months. But we've got a couple of dozen original essays on data visualization now. And so the way that that works is that we try to get folks, writers to do one of two things, either to basically transcribe conversations and attribute and sort of trim and edit them. And the other is to take, and what I prefer is to try to distill out of them rather than just sort of reporting on the conversations, trying themselves to add a layer of meaning on top of that. And that's starting to work out more and more and it depends on sort of the subject area. Probably the most vibrant channel we have as far as the medium publication goes is that historical data visualization channel, where we just have a lot of motivated and experienced writers who are super interested in the wealth of historical data visualization. And they've been putting out just a lot of amazing work.",

And then interacting with other folks and pointing them to resources and using tools you've never heard of to make data visualization that oftentimes looks the same as the stuff that you've been making with some other completely different set of tools.

And I think that just environmentally, it's been so positive all over the place that what it's done is it started to foster these questions of how can we be even more actively engaged with helping people to get better at their practice. So one of the things that we've been talking about almost since the beginning, because it came up early and it's come up often, is trying to arrange mentorship programs and trying to arrange ways to sort of evaluate teaching programs and educational resources and things like that, because people have asked for that and people have helped with that.

And what I love is telling them, hey, go over to the career advice channel and tell people what kind of people you're looking for and what kind of interviews you're giving and all of this, and just trying to get folks who are in these leadership positions to sort of speak in a socratic sense to the community. And that to me, is an amazing opportunity for folks on both sides because I feel like, you know, there's a lot of early career folks who don't know what's expected of them. And then, frankly, I think there's a lot of leadership folks who don't quite haven't really thought critically or structurally about what kind of people they're looking to hire.

I want to come back to something, Elijah, you touched upon before, or also we've been discussing about slack and medium, which is on the one hand the openness and on the other hand the platform aspect. Because one thing I've been thinking about, and what I've been also a bit skeptical in the beginning is that, well, with slack and all these services, you have to sign up and you have to register, and it is closed because it's not part of the open web. So you can just link to a slack conversation. And so I'm thinking a bit now. I think it's amazing how the momentum is in the community, but thinking long term, I think about. Okay, do you have any plans to move the most valuable resources to the open web and make them also editable on the open web? Because my concern personally, I'm much more convinced by now that we need to own our own platforms and cannot rely on sites like MySpace or Facebook, which might go away at some point. No, but it's really because I've seen it happen by now. I mean, that's a bit like old man talking, but I've seen platforms go away, and I'd love to have your stuff stick around for decades. So what are your thoughts currently on how you can make this platform sustainable? Or maybe you're not even thinking about that because you're still so busy keeping up with the current momentum.

So there has been dialogue around kind of the pros and cons of a variety of different tools and communication platforms. Right now, though, there's actually. There's a lot of things that are really good about Slacken and that people have expressed they really like about it. One is the kind of what we talked about before, about being able to kind of just show up and not be someone that someone knows, but be able to post something and have it noticed if it's awesome. But then there's also been some people who expressed that they really liked it because this private forum allowed them to participate when they don't feel comfortable, for different reasons, to put their information out there in a Google and, like, public way. So it allowed them to feel more comfortable. It also helps us to enforce the code of conduct a lot easier. And. Yeah, so that's.

On all of these platforms, people have said that for a long time, our original decision to go with medium and Slack was ease of use and accessibility like that, it was going to be easy for us to set up and maintain. And folks had some level of familiarity with it, and they, you know, and these companies have, as their product, have leveraged the ability to make these things easier and more visible. That said, almost as soon as we started, people showed up and said, well, why don't we have a discord, and why don't we have a discourse, and why can't this be public, and why can't this be searchable? And I don't want this to stay here. And so we've been evaluating that almost from the very beginning. There's some discussions about how to take the slack content and perhaps put it out on a forum. But then to get back to Amy and Molly's point, what we've actually heard from, in a couple of cases, especially when we were doing the medium distillations, was we actually heard from members who said, I don't want my name on this publication.

But the problem is, is that we can't constrain that to members only. And so this becomes this question of who are you providing this for? And what are they using it for? And that's what's tremendously challenging. And we would love, as Amy was saying, and Molly, we'd love ideas for how to address that. My current idea for how to address that is to try to ramp up this distillation and summarization process, because I think that's the best of what's coming out of this, right. Is people's voices and people's ideas, not necessarily their exact words, in a moment when they were chatting on slack during work time about off topic things or something like that.

On many days, half of the conversations, and there have been 50,000 plus messages on slack, half of the conversations are direct messages. Oh, wow. So what's going on with the data visualization society is that there's a public conversation. That's a fire hose. But then what else is going on is people are connecting and. And networking with each other to an enormous degree, and we can't, to be very, very clear, we do not have a plan that allows us to archive or see or do anything with those private conversations. So please continue to have them.

So we're going to do one for 2019. We're going to pull together people and have this broader audience of over 5000 people that we can get to invite to take this survey of the field. We're also going to provide a little bit of incentive for people who take it. So I think that will increase our response rate to what he previously had. We're going to work on creating a mentoring program later this year. We've worked on highlighting members to showcase other people in the community. So our Patreon basically covers our basic costs, like hosting, domain name email marketing. When we started, that was all coming out of me and Elijah and Molly's pockets.

We're on number two right now, where we try to expose data from what membership or this latest one has been the conversations that have been happening on slack. And so for the first one, which was the first 3500 members or something a long time ago, when we only had 3500 members, and we asked our members to visualize them. And so people came up with a lot of different representations. And because we had these three values that you could visualize. And the visualization I did was that each member was turned into a little dungeons and dragons style adventurer. And their sword was based on their visualization skill, and their shield was based on their data skill, and their hat was based on their society skill. And then the color of their shirt and the color of their pants were based on their latitude and longitude. So they made 3500 tiny little adventurers. And what I found out, unexpectedly, was when somebody didn't put any answers in, then it looked like they weren't holding or carrying anything. So they looked like they were just going to punch you which I thought was cute. But then if they didn't put their location in, there were null values for Latin long and so entirely unintentionally it made those people look like they were little ninjas. And so I just left it in there because it was such a. It was such a fun little. Yeah. So I did that. And then just recently for Easter, we sent out data driven Easter eggs to all the members too. So you got an Easter egg that was decorated based on your. How you self ranked. And then it also had a yolk and an egg white that the color was based on your number one and number two skills.

Every one of these answers is optional. So one of the bits of pushback we had was that this was an onerous requirement to join the community. So we tried to make it more clear that you don't have to rate yourself. You can end up a ninja just like we were talking about. It's great. But you do have to give us an email address because we can't email you or invite you onto the slacken without an email address. So that's going to kind of be a requirement. And then once you join, what does that mean? Well, it means you'll get an email newsletter from us. It may be every two or three or four weeks. And you'll also be allowed to take part in the conversations on the slack with thousands of other data visualization members. And then from there you'll probably make all sorts of amazing connections. You'll be able to talk to IIB award winners like Moritz and Amy and they'll tell you how to win awards.
