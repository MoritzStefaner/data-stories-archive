So we had some politics and psychology and design. So it's a really neat program. Anyways, I did actually my final thesis project for this degree I actually already did at the University of Calgary as a sort of diploma intern with Sheelagh Carpendale and Kerry Williamson. And this project sort of got me hooked into sort of visualization and information seeking. So visual search as sort of a label which at the beginning I didn't really like, but now I think it sort of fits what I'm doing. And this project, yeah, I really enjoyed sort of dynamic queries for blogs on the web. Sort of the idea of juxtaposing different simple visualizations of maybe time map or location and tags and using that to explore or filter through blog posts and other stuff. Yeah. And anyway, so during that time I actually noticed that visualization is, or information visualization is not just a tool for, not just a useful tool for data analysis, but also really for sort of this open ended information seeking sort of moving around in large complex information spaces. And I actually stayed or came back to Calgary for doing a PhD with Sheelagh Carpentale and Kerry Williamson. And during that time I was sort of going really deep into that subject. I did a few case studies. I also did some internships at industry labs where we sort of dealt with Twitter data, with academic publications and sort of rich collections where essentially the data is not just data but it has these rich complex links among it and it sort of invites not just for analysis but actually also for sort of navigation and looking around. So that's. I finished that PhD a little bit over a year ago, one and a half years ago. And then I went to Newcastle University in the UK where I did a one year postdoc working on the Patina project where we tried to develop visual interfaces for archives and for playful text analysis. And yeah, fairly freshly. I'm now in Berlin since October, working at the University of Applied Sciences in Potsdam and I'm really happy to be there. Both students and staff are super friendly and interested and actually I have a sort of funny position. It's called a research professorship. So that means that I have, compared to other sort of polytechnic like universities, which in Germany are called fachochschulen, I have a reduced teaching load and I'm sort of expected and or I'm allowed to do lots of research.

      "text": "Yeah, it was urban design theory. So sort of city studies or. Yeah, city urban theory. Urban studies. And so we read about, yeah, different design thinking around the city, city planning, but also sort of from cultural studies and sort of literature to some degree. And I came across this notion of the flaneur, of the urban wanderer of the 19th century sort of roaming the streets of Paris. And it's sort of beautiful picture of a curious fella enjoying the city and being maybe also being critical. But the thing is, I came across this during an exam, sort of a midway exam or. Yeah, like sort of a time during the PhD where I had to write a report, sort of. I had some questions for it, and I was sort of, I don't know, like I was sort of, I wanted to write about something else, not visualization and research questions and blah. So I had actually, I actually introduced in that paper, I introduced an x course, sort of a distraction section that was about the flaneur. And I was sort of making that leap that maybe the flaneur, maybe that notion of this curious strolling guy is actually what visualization can do for rich information spaces. And so for me, that was sort of a way to keep my mind interested in that task of writing that paper. And in the end, and I tried to find linkages, and in the end, supervisor Sheelagh Carpentale, she said, well, Marianne, actually, this is it. This is what really captures what visualization can do when we search through and explore collections and information spaces. And then I started to sort of revisit this more seriously. And actually there are some really interesting linkages, and I found it to be really fruitful. So now, how? So in the end, the flaneur gives us a new perspective on the city. So while we might see the city as a place for economy, so for work and for living and for commerce, the flaneur sees the city sort of curiously along different senses, smells, sounds, but is also a sort of critical person who questions. So at the time when the flaneur came up as a sort of cultural figure, industrialization was picking up steam, literally, and capitalism was sort of, you know, bringing up all different kinds of issues and anonymity and just the. And maybe also poverty and so forth. So the planeur is not just a dandy enjoying and being fascinated by the city, but also someone who notices, oh, there's all these other things that are happening that are also problematic. So he develops by wandering around, by reflecting, by taking in the different perceptions, he develops his own perspective. And also he sort of walks at a different pace that gives him a privileged sensation of the city. And then also is someone, maybe someone poetic, someone creative, also sort of reimagines what city life could be. And I was sort of reading all these different texts like Walter Benjamin and others, and I thought, wow, that's such a, you know, and I also was also sort of picking the good bits. You know, there are also issues with this, with this figure we can talk about later. But, and I found this attitude of that flaneur towards the city, towards this new cultural backdrop. You know, back then, 19th century, was this growing cultural backdrop for most of the things that were happening in terms of culture and science and so forth. The flanur posed an interesting attitude and an interesting perspective. And I think we can borrow that. We can borrow the flannel's attitude to think about how we engage with digital information as the web is becoming the cultural backdrop for everything that we do. If we go to a theater play or if we go to a conference or if we just have breakfast, Twitter or some other social media site, whatever is always with us, email is with us, we are sharing photos on Instagram and so forth. So the web has become that, I think, that complementary backdrop. Besides the physical urban sphere, there's also the digital sphere. And I think the information flaneur is my attempt to frame the searcher or the viewer or the person engaging with the digital around positive aspects, around curiosity, around reflection and creativity. And I tried to contrast that sort of optimistic or idealistic Persona with the models that we had before information seeking. So traditionally, the searcher, from what I was sort of comparing the sort of the role of visualization, the searcher was framed around deficiencies like information needs, knowledge gaps, problems. Actually, a recent paper talked about the pathology, the dark side of information pathologies. So, sure. I mean, I think, yeah, anxiety and, you know, sure, we all, you know, we are all patients, but in a way. But I don't want to design for a patient. I don't want to design medicine. It also has this sort of bitterness to it. Yeah. And I think, and I think we can also turn it around. And there's actually evidence that people are enjoying when they encounter more data. You know, genealogists in North America, they're crazy about new data. Once they find a new archive, more dust to go through, they're just excited about it. And there's so many examples of our sort of day to day information practices as we roam bookshops or just scan our environment where such as serendipity, such as information encountering, people actually have positive information experiences. And so the information planeur became sort of, on the one hand, using the planeur as a lens. And then it's not just, you know, I'm not just imagining or dreaming up my favorite user Persona, but I actually then use evidence from studies about emotion and perception and just also information practices and bring them together.",

So sort of post hoc, I could say, yeah, it sort of fits the model, but they weren't really designed towards the information flaneur. The first visualization that actually was explicitly designed for sort of strolling through information spaces was a project I've done at Microsoft Research called Pivot Paths. So it's a visualization interface with which you can explore academic publications, and in particular you can look at authors, publications and keywords. Everything hinges on the publications, the authors, and also then co authorship relationships, as well as the keywords associated with these papers. And the interface. Essentially, after you've chosen a starting point, which is not really the main point of the tool, after you've chosen maybe an author, you are presented with maybe her most cited 20 papers. And then the interface arranges. So this is shown horizontally in the middle. And then above and below you have a sort of visualization that shows the most frequent keywords. Below and above you see all the authors, all the co authors of this author, of the selected author. Of course, it's talking about visualization without showing, but let's pretend our listeners actually have it right in front of their eyes right now.",

But the way we move on the web, either by changing search queries or by clicking on links, is very abrupt. You know, one display change after another, you don't actually see the overlap between these. And with pivot paths, we try to connect these states, because as you move from author a to author B, there must be an overlap because author B is already co author from a.

But I think that there's potential to integrate visualization, how do you say, magic fairy dust into conventional interfaces. Like maybe a search interface can actually benefit from some visualization components. There's a nice, a nice library catalog interface from UTS, which is I think the technical uni of Sydney. So the UTS library interface has a Dewey decimal classification visualization that is quite minimalistic. It's just a tiny band that is above the result display. And it sort of visualizes how many books are in each Dewey category. And you don't have to use it, you can just ignore it. But if you enter a search term such as architecture, it will actually shape or it will stretch or shrink the corresponding categories. And so you see sort of maybe, oh, architecture is actually not just in, I don't know, I don't know what the labels are for the different top categories, but it's maybe not just culture or architecture, but it's also computer science because people are talking about, you know, system architectures and so forth. And if you're actually interested in computing architectures, you could then click on that, on that category and it would then also behave as a filtering mechanism. So you can use the visualization in a very sort of lightweight way to sort of dive into a subset of the catalog without having to actually specify this is the Dewey decimal thing or actually specify the code. So this is an example of where you have actually visualization being introduced to an existing search or filtering interface without actually turning the whole interface into a visualization.

So it's essentially, it's a way of, how do you say, informing your path by, for example, the activity of others before. But I think you can also use other data sources for it. Yeah, that's a good question. I think information sent is slightly different because it uses some external source, I think, if I understand it correctly, such as social activity, and blends it with your typical interface.

And it's this notion of navigating similar to pivot paths between individual elements, but then actually still showing the whole collection around these elements. And we call it monadic because it's inspired or informed by sort of philosophical and sociological concept of the monads of something that Bruno Latour, a french sociologist, has been writing about over the last couple years. And it essentially is sort of alternative to the distinction between the micro and the macro. So instead of talking about the individual and society, he argues that society is really hard to grasp anyways, and the individual is too little to actually make sense of. So why don't we take the individual and you know, in sociology it would be a human, maybe in our case it would be data points, resources. If we take the individual element as a position and as a vantage point on the whole world, and the whole world might be a collection of photos, or maybe in sociological terms it might be society, then we could now, in terms of visualization, we could arrange the collection or the data set around that individual element in a way that still shows this is this element's perspective. You know, it's very unique. It's how, you know, it relates strongly or weakly with other elements, but it doesn't show just the immediate neighbors or the immediate properties of that element, but actually allows you to see beyond that. So on the sort of metaphorically speaking, on the horizon, you would still see the elements that this element is not so much related to. So you could then navigate, so to speak, to the other side of the data set, if you make that choice.",

So instead of following the overview first path, starting from one specific seed point, is not only interesting as a way to explorer data set or might be interesting for exploration and serendipity, I also have practical examples where this kind of paradigm can be really, really useful because it matches much, much better the mental model that people have of the problem that they want to solve. So to give you a specific example, actually this comes from my own work. A few years back, I was working with a group of biologist, and so these people is interested in finding specific molecules that have certain behaviors. Okay. And for months and months we kept working on overviews of the old data set that they get out of these experiments that involve hundreds of thousands of molecules. And every time we showed our results to them, the reaction was always kind of like, yeah, that's interesting, but there was always a but at the end, right? And I had a very hard time because we tried kind of like three or four different, kind of completely different visual, visual designs, right? And then one day I started speaking with this guy, a biochemistry and Olina Sade, and I realized, man, these people are really much interested. They're not interested at all in the overview. They don't want to detect patterns. They want to see what happens around some specific molecules they're interested in, right? So the way they think about the problem is what happens around this molecule. So even if they have a thousand, a million or whatever kind of molecules as an outcome from their experiment, they have an entry, as an entry point. They think about, I want to see what happens around this set of molecules, then around can mean ten hundred thousand and so on, right? But here you have a specific example of how even in practical terms, and even in projects where the focus is pretty much on problem solving, the way they think about the problem might actually lead to a design that starts from a specific city point. And I think this can apply to many other cases. So I have the feeling that there are cases where the way a person thinks about the problem matches very, very well with the idea of starting from one seed point or a few seed points. And I think this is somewhat unexplored.",

I think what is useful and what is sort of also inviting is a representation, an interface that, how do you say, respects the ethos and the aesthetics of a collection. Maybe that's not what the biologists are after, but actually developing a sensibility for the data and also for the context and for the aura or for, you know, the spirit and going back to the esoteric stuff. Right. Actually, sort of the softer aspects that might not play to what we think or what we have thought, what visualization is about. But I think we should also keep that in mind.

And, you know, Personas have been around in design thinking for years, maybe ages, I don't know. But, you know, that's, that's already, I think that's already. That can be useful to have a concrete person with certain abilities and characteristics and so forth. Now, to actually move this forward into, into your design process, I found the notion of explorability very useful. So to me, this is like a complementary principle besides usability, while usability speaks to the sort of interface mechanisms, you know, are the buttons, do they have the right size, is the text legible and so forth. It's sort of usability, in my eyes, describes a relationship between interface and hardware and or, you know, artifacts and the user or the viewer and so forth. And for me, explorability, in a way says, yeah, there can be hardware, software, visualizations blah, blah. These are sort of the mediating things. But let's talk about the relationship between the content or the information space or the data and the searcher or the viewer, right? So human and information maybe. And I think explorability is useful because it speaks to, well, we really want to have this flannel engage with the data, move around and then under that sort of umbrella term, explorability. How can we make information space explorable? I found sort of three guiding concepts useful. First, orientation. So think about how your interface shows you where you are in an information space and also where you can go. So make invitations for your next navigation steps, and also vice versa, give a way to, or provide mechanisms to trace back your, or to go back to where you started. So the obvious sort of function in a browser is of course the back button or the browser's history, something that actually is still not very often supported in visualizations, so that you can actually have sort of like an implicit, well, not bookmarks, we can also use it for bookmarks, but an implicit sort of history of the navigation steps that we have in the visualization. So that's sort of orientation both where we have been and also where we can go. And then there's this principle of visual momentum. It's sort of this notion of perceptual continuity that describes that when we have two subsequent display states, how much overlap is between them. So when I move from one search result page to the next because I added a new query term, maybe there's actually overlap between the results and visual momentum. If there's a high level of visual momentum, I can actually make the connection because maybe a result item moves a few steps up and it's actually animated to that state. But this actually in our, you know, in today's search interfaces, visual momentum is very low because we have abrupt changes. So if you want to support that sort of more continuous experience through an information space, think about how the subsequent display states are intertwined and sort of connected through transitions and animations and so forth. Don't overdo it. You know, it doesn't always make sense. It might be quite distracting to use, you know, rotating, whatever crazy animations, but where it makes sense, where actually the same elements are between two display states, try to create some continuity so that your perceptual apparatus is not always asked, oh, where am I? Where am I? Where's the element from the last display state and so forth. And the third sort of concept is, I find quite hard to design for serendipity but I think it's important as designers of these sort of visualizations and information interfaces is to think about how we make invitations to discover things that we didn't look for and actually pursue these sort of information encounters. And we talked about this already quite a bit, but essentially show things that are related for maybe strange reasons or for unexpected reasons.",
