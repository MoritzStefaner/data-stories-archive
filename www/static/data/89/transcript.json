They are investigating the work of the government. So corruption is a big problem here in Hungary, and they usually create visualizations about maybe the relationships of the representatives of the parliament, or just about spending of the public money. So this is one thing that is really big, and the other one is that I found interesting is because I used to go to an art and design university, and I know that this generative graphic design is very popular right now. So some of the designers use real data and the output starts to look like a data visualization, a real data visualization. So there are explanations behind them, and I think sooner or later some of them will become data visualization designers. I can give an example for this, because I have a very interesting one.",

But we had three big data visualization, three big data visualization challenges, like competitions. And it was surprising because it was really good. They had a really big databases, like the usage of the public bike system in the capital city. Or there was another one with a full database of the real estate advertisements in the world country. Two days ago was this 24 hours data visualization hackathon that was using data from T Mobile Hungary. And I wondered before that, why are there so many competitions here in Hungary, by many, if you consider the size of the country. And I talked to some people and they told me that they have a huge amount of data and they don't know what to make. They have the data there and they don't know how to use it, how the business can profit from it.

And of course they want to create an accessible database for it. So I'm very, very interested in that project and I hope it will be published next year. And the other thing I'm interested in that there is some collaboration between telecom innovation laboratories. It is called T-Labs and they are at TU Berlin. And there is this Hungarian university, Alta. And this university has. This university just had a new data science department. So there will be collaboration between the two organizations.

And I think our traction came a bit 2015 because we were working around data visualizations in elections. We were using data visualization to tell stories about data in elections. So it's pretty, pretty interesting here because, I mean, so when you go online, for example, and you try to, let's say for some, for example, a person who is still trying to learn how to visualize data, and you are from Nigeria, so when you go online, for example, you can find really fine courses that teach you, that probably teach you data visualization just like that. I mean, you may just find one or two, and the second guys you're going to find is us. But when you go to, let's say you go Google and you search again and you probably find a lot of courses on edX, you probably find a lot of courses on coursera. And these people, they use, they teach data visualization using hadroup, using Python and the whole other programmer programming languages. But down here we still do a bit, a few things or a lot of things. Let me use the word manually in the where. So we don't use the software that they use like in the rest of the world because they are advanced. And why we started our data is because we tried to understand what was happening and the importance of data and where data was going to. But of course we, we couldn't just jump to where the rest of the world was. We had to use the simple tools, we had to try to communicate in the simple ways for the ordinary nigerian to actually know what data visualization is. I mean, we can wake up one day and start talking about Hadoop or strata or python languages. I mean, people don't even know what open data is. People don't even know what data visualization is in simple terms, you know. So I think we just started by using the simple tools we could find to at least just show them the idea of how data can look like, of how beautiful information could look like, you know. So presently there are just about maybe three or four of us and it's still a very small, and it's still a very small sector. But I mean, it's still, it's still very open, too.",

      "text": "Okay, so a bit of. In 2014, we started walking around. Okay, so we, a couple of friends, we started looking around, looking at what the world was talking about. The world was talking about big data and analytics and the future of data revolution. And we started studying these things and to understand it even more and how we could impact the nigerian society. And so when we got to the end of our research, we decided we were going to do, we were going to tell stories using visual data visualizations. But then we asked ourselves a question, what story should we tell? And we looked for the next biggest thing in Nigeria then. And that was the nigerian elections. Yes. So we had our elections in 2015, but before 2014, we decided to do to resell stories using data visualizations. But then these were going to be data elections, data related to Nigeria elections. So we looked at the history, we looked at history of violence in Nigeria. We looked at history of data, election data in Nigeria. Election polling units, election accounts, polling counts, and of course, voters registration card distribution. So we understood that these were something people will want to look at. These were something that people will probably be interested in. But we also understood that the last time there was an election in Nigeria was in 2011. And then social media, for example, Twitter, for example, was not that popular in Nigeria yet. People probably had just signed up. I signed up in 2009, but I didn't become active until 2011. And it's happened like that for so many, so many people. And even around that time, people didn't know what Twitter was. We weren't using Twitter, you know, so it hasn't been used before. So we thought about the fact that data visualization and infographics have not been used on nigerian Twitter before to drive engagement and citizen inclusion towards the election. So we figured it was something we could do. So we tried to mine data. We tried to. We, of course, we had a few programs that we worked with, open source programs that we worked with to get some sentiment analysis and social trends on how the Nigerians were thinking and what they wanted. Because the truth was, we wanted to create infographics, we wanted to create visual data. But the truth was we needed to understand what they wanted. We needed to understand what the problem was, what the information the people needed. And of course, we came up with a lot of things and we produced a lot of information products that were centered around the elections, from. From election violence to voting procedures in 60 seconds, to the types of, sorry, what would I call it? The candidates. The election candidates. People who wanted to vote didn't even know who their candidates was. They didn't even know, for example, the House of Representative, as we call it in the United States, the Congress, for example. People didn't know who their candidates were and who to vote for. So we use data visualization to try to portray that. And of course, we understood that people were on Twitter and they were tweeting that they used Twitter as a key point of accessing information. So we didn't want to take them away from Twitter, but rather to bring information to them on Twitter. So we used every information we were publishing on Twitter was simply an infographics. And it was, yeah, it was data visualization. And for everyone we published, they went viral. Everyone published, they all went viral. And for us, it gave us one simple understanding, that people wanted infographics, people wanted data visualization, even though they didn't know what it was. But when they saw it, they saw the beautiful information, they loved it. And so we said, yeah. And so we started with elections. Elections. And then between December 12 and April, December 12, 2014 and April 11, 2015, that was around when the election had relapsed. The general election has elapsed. We had reached a total of about 926,000 people online using infographics.",

For example, we know that the internally displaced persons issues. It's a global issue in Nigeria. Here we have our own problems, too, which is as a result of the Boko Haram crisis we have in Nigeria today. Yes. So we have started telling stories using data visualization as well to try to highlight the plight of the internal displaced persons we have in Nigeria to try to tell stories, to show the gaps, the funding gaps, to also try to show a lot of issues. For example, that was one of the things we did. If you can google it online, it was called child trafficking in IDP's camp. So if you google it, I'm sure the first four or five websites you see will probably have our infographics on top of it.",

And the truth is, we are not where the world is. The whole rest of the world, for example, is. I mean, in terms of people like, let's say United States, for example, and London, for example, what they do with is amazing because of all these amazing softwares and amazing programming languages. They used to, you know, to read these things and read data and all that. And then here in Nigeria, we are still doing things, I call it the manual way, using a little bit of the photo editing tools and the other analytical tools like power Bi and the rest of them. But I think in 2017, I'm looking at the possibility whereby the big guns in the United States, for example, let me say the top data visualizing companies in Nigeria, in us, for example, can probably take a look at what we are doing here in Nigeria and see how they can perhaps partner with one of us, perhaps with our data for us, for example, and see how we can use or leverage their biggest tool to do and of course push up the work we are doing here in Nigeria. Because of course, the truth about thing about this thing is building the software locally is a big headache. But of course, getting a major partnership, for example, with a big data visualization company in New York City, for example, is going to be a big win for us, you know, in 2017. So I look at opportunities whereby in 2017 World New York City companies in New York City are seeing what is happening in Nigeria today and picking out the big guys, the players, and saying, okay, how can we do this, how can we work together and how can we partner to even move data visualization further to the next level in Nigeria?

That was until two months ago. And now I'm working. I'm back, actually, to folate. So, Paulo, it's a place, a newspaper. I've worked for five years, two years ago, and I'm working there as a collaborator, doing specific special projects, sometimes from inside the newsroom, but sometimes outside in the newsroom. And in general, my background is in news for infographics. So I've been doing a lot of animations, 3d animations, and data visualizations, also for both print and the web. So I came from a print background, and then I started to migrate to the web. And I always done some research in doing experimental projects with game engines, for instance, and with virtual reality. So those are things that I try to explore and, well, working on newspapers and we always have to do a lot of things. So I've also been have a big foot into the cartography and tried to do it sometimes some experimentations, mixing video with cartography and things like that.",

I think on the last years we have seen in Brazil, we have some newspapers doing a good job on that field. For instance, we call it Istadong. They have doing a good job, a solid job. I think on the last five years they built a data team and then they had developers. So they have done solid work. I think we have some. We have projects, also good projects outside the newsrooms. We have info Amazonia, which is a very good job on cartography surveillance on the Amazon forest. So they gather data about deforestations and fire and the cattle productions and their polys, mapping and updating it. And I think that's a good example also on Datavis. And we have some new stuff coming on that I think we're going to talk about a little later, but I think those are good projects. Talking more about South America, I've seen La Nation in Argentina, which did a very good job in 2015 as they had national elections. So they did very good visualizations on the results, but also analyzing the candidates speech. I think they are ahead of on this data we've seen on the continent. They're doing very good.",

It's still going on, just I'm not there anymore. But it was a project that had a bigger focus on database investigations. So since the beginning they hired people like me with infographics, visual background, but also a data scientist who's Danyel Mariani, who works with r and has a good experience on that, doing jobs on for academic projects. And they built the newsroom in a way that the graphics department was quite independent to do its own stories. So that was kind of a new thing. Here in Brazil we don't see too many editorial with giving that attention to data and to visualization. So I think that's something that it's worth mentioning. So I think we achieved good things there. And another project that. Another thing that I would like to mention here in Brazil, I think the global newspaper, it's based at Rio de Janeiro, they also did some good projects. They already had some sort of tradition doing infographics. They have Alessandro Wien, who is quite known for doing visual stories, more illustrated stories, and doing his own investigations on the subjects and doing long form stories and. But like, maybe two years ago, they hired some people from Stadan, for instance, and they. They started to build a more solid, more solid department for visuals, putting together, like, developers, designers, journalists. And as we had, like this year, national elections, for like, local elections, actually, but being done, like, on the whole country. And they did, like, very good cartography, visualizations, graphics, both print and web. So I hope they keep doing like, this kind of things. Well, speaking more like, globally, I think that we have a good year for cartography. Yeah, definitely. I see that the approach to maps is getting more mature. It's not that we had, maybe we also had, but something that took my attention was not like the very innovative projects, but is the level of discussion that maps are getting and how it's getting more. The discussion on maps, it's getting more closer to the readers. So we had, like, for instance, New York Times, on the upshot, they wrote a post talking about their history on cartography and how they use it, cartograms and choroplets in their history. And this is for the readers. I think it shows that people are getting more interested in thinking about how maps are done and how journalistic ethics applies. Yeah. Two maps.",

And like, they have, like, they build a website, it's called GeoSampa, where you can download shape files and all kinds of data about where hospitals, schools are and, you know, like traffic information.

So those are things also that are very, very hard to understand. Like, those are like big numbers for budget and then you have, like, for Social Security, you have so many things that are playing some role on how to calculate how it's going to affect people that are going to retire, like in five years or in ten years or 40 years. So all this, those subjects, I think they're very important and they are very hard to deal with. So I think those are places where we should aim and focus. Talking about, at least here in Brazil, we also have like the Zika disease that is still spreading like it got. We have less cases, but we used to have a lot of cases of baby born with, how do you call it, bad formations on their bodies, on their brains. And it's gonna, I hope it doesn't grow more as a public disease, but it can happen as we are getting into a hotter period here on the south, we're gonna into summer, and that's when the mosquito starts to spread more. And so those are things that are very like, they concern a lot of people. Everybody that, I mean, just everybody is concerned. And people are like making, planning if they are going to have kids or not, based on that, for instance. And there is not a lot of information, it's still blurry data on that side. So we don't have a lot to work with. But I think that we are going to see more and more information coming, I hope. And then I think there is something that we should also focus and expect to see also good visual storytelling on that. And then speaking more globally. I think there is, I think, a general concern in terms of format when we doing, when we're doing visual storytelling and dealing with visual data. And that's mostly like working with mobile devices, for instance. And I think that's a big concern because when we're working with print, for instance, you can do like very interesting big poster visualizations, but doing that on mobile, it's very tricky and it's very costly. And we haven't seen, we haven't seen some good stuff, but they're usually very expensive on the coding side. So something I would like to see, and I think I would invest too. And I think that's one way trying to get on the back to the, to the roots of like, just using these limitations as something that can lead us to some creativity. So doing like static, vertical stories and developing this language and not seeing this as a problem or, and seeing is more like it's, it's the way we have to do. People are using cell phones. So let's try to, to research and do things that are not so costly and that can still be very compelling as visual stories on that format. I think that we have tools for that. We have AI to HTML that is very user friendly for people coming from the design side. We can build stories, I think, using more aesthetic and more classic tools and don't limitate ourselves by the device limitations.",

Qlik allows you to explore the hidden relationships within your data that lead to meaningful insights. Let your instincts lead the way to create personalized visualizations and dynamic dashboards with Qlik sense, which you can download for free at www.Qlik.de/Datastories . So Qlik is organizing for the end of the year a very interesting webinar on the top bi trends for 2017. And this is going to happen on January 11. So if you're interested in participating, look for this episode's blog post and you'll find the link to the registration webpage. Don't miss out and reserve your spot today. So in the past we have witnessed it to a lot of trends, an explosion of data, an increase in processing, and a move towards information activism. But is the gap widening between the data and our ability to consume it? How will these patterns impact the bi industry in the coming year? So if you want to hear answers to these questions, join Qlik senior director and former Gartner analyst Dan Sommer for his top ten predictions for 2017, and you'll hear about how the digital and physical worlds will begin to meet in analytics, how the two sides of personal analytics will change the industry, how the rise of modern bi will affect the self service model, and find out whether you've missed any of the signals and where your focus should be in the coming months. So join the Qlik seminar on the top bi trends for 2017. And now back to the show. We have Nikita (Rokotyan) on the show. Welcome. How are you?",

Things that are now very popular in creative technology. But I always felt that my defi would like somehow to combine and one of my background is science and my another background is, let's say, creative technology and design. And it turned out to be that data visualization is a perfect fit for my background and grounds that my interests and I have started to dig more into it. And being a scientist, I did a lot of data visualizations, but they were all static. Most of packages for science there are static data visualization things. You just draw a picture. And I really felt that there is a lack of nice visualizations in scientific world. And I wanted to go beyond and build some tools that will allow me and people around me to understand more what I'm doing and different phenomena around the world.

So I'm really looking forward what's going to happen next year and year after that, because big companies are starting small teams who are doing, currently, they're doing data analysis and data visualization at the same time.

I want to run to create a couple projects that will visualize data around Russia. It's a huge country and there is a lot of data, and it's quite difficult to find interactive images of that. So it will be very interesting to see and show people, the whole country, but visually, I mean, data behind the country. And personally, I really want to explore more 3d technologies in data visualization because I came from a background of creative developer, and for me it was naturally to work with libraries like cinder processing, and it was all 3d based. And now in data visualization, I think 95% people are using D3, which is great. I love that tool. But at the same time, there are quite a few projects where I would like to have this high performance 3d abilities.",

And at the same time, I really see that if we just create a website and visualize the data somehow so everybody can just go there and look at it, and it can be a huge breakthrough in terms of making science more popular and making people understand science more and even kids to inspire kids to do science, engineering, technology and all that.

It doesn't pop up in my filter bubble all that often. I've been running the Brisbane chapter of hacks, hackers for the last year. And just over the past year, the diversity of people who've been showing up to talk and talk about this stuff and to even present their work has really surprised me in a lot of ways for what is quite a small place, Brisbane.

Two of the bigger organizations doing work in this area in Australia are probably the Guardian and the ABC, who I work for. And the first one I'd call out is one from the Guardian, which I really quite liked. It was in some ways quite a simple thing, but it's a project about whether your personal viewpoint is reflected in the new parliament. We had an election in the middle of this year, and so we've got a whole new set of politicians. And the Guardian did this great little interactive where you could select sort of personal attributes, you could select your gender and your age range, things like sexual orientation and education levels, and it would filter the representatives in the new federal parliament to a list that kind of matched those same attributes and just see how, really see how few parliamentarians kind of line up with your demographic.",

      "text": "Yeah, so I guess another one I'd point to is one that we did. I didn't personally work on this one, but one of the other guys in our team did most of the visualisation on it. And it's, again, about the politics and about the new parliament we've got here. And one of the issues that the new parliament has is our Senate, is the government doesn't have a majority in the Senate, so they're going to have to deal with a bunch of crossbenchers in order to get legislation through. And so there's quite a mix of funny voting blocks in the new parliament, in the Senate. And so we just wanted to really explain to people what the government's going to have to do and who they're going to have to negotiate with in order to get various pieces of their legislative agenda through the parliament. And this one, I think, actually ties in quite well to what I see as one of the trends of 2016, which is a change away from kind of these big, sprawling, undirected, exploratory data visualizations to a more focused, narrative driven visualization where you're telling a story but using visualization to kind of aid the telling of that rather than kind of be the telling of that. So as you scroll down this page, I'll just describe it a little bit. It's essentially what is Malcolm Turnbull up against in the new Senate. And as you scroll down, there's a number of scenarios that we sort of explain. And as you scroll through each of the different scenarios, these little dots that represent individual parliamentarians kind of move across the screen and stack up either to the left or the right. And it shows clearly if the votes fall that way for a particular piece of legislation, whether the legislation will pass or be blocked.",

One of my favorite little visualizations for the year, I say little. It probably wasn't really when it was being built, but the New York Times did a baseball feature on Derek Jeter. I'm not a huge baseball fan, but he's a big hitter who's retired recently, and it sort of visualized his 342,000 swings of his career and used a little video of him doing a swing to visualize just how enormous that is and how his career went.

And I think that it's kind of a chicken and an egg thing in a lot of ways. I think mobile's sort of driving move to smaller infographics in some ways, smaller visualizations, but also I think it's forcing us to think about the usability of these sorts of things we're building and think about how people are experiencing them. And that actually might have better outcomes even for people on bigger screens. And I expect that to continue just because the take up of mobile is continuing to grow, as you'd expect. And the last trend I'd probably really be interested in seeing how it goes over the next year is I think there's been some huge changes in the tools we use this year, and especially around tools encouraging best practice for visualizations and charts and graphics in a way that they haven't been great at previously.",

Doing an FOI request for data is a fairly painful process most of the time because your first point of contact doesn't know the basic lingo. They don't understand what a record layout is, for example, oftentimes. So it'd be great to see a bit more data literacy filtering out into more parts of my world.

And so the idea came from the earthquake in Japan and where the nuclear thing happened, and they were collecting a lot of radiation data.

If you're not familiar with, Patreon is a new platform, and it's becoming incredibly, incredibly successful. There are lots of people out there who are financing their show or other endeavors to Patreon. So the way Patreon works is that you subscribe to Patreon and you commit to paying a small fee. You can choose among a range of amounts. And every time we publish a new episode, you would pay this fee. Okay. And so what we want to do is say if this is to see if this is possible. So we want to slowly transition to this new model. And that would mean that if we manage to completely transition, then we will be able to remove our ads completely, which I think it's a good thing.

There will also be a link in the blog post, of course, and you can think about, do you want to maybe chip in with a few dollars or euros or yen, whatever your local currency is. And I think the way we will do it is so we have a fixed cost per episode. And once we reach that cost in terms of budget, we can do one ad free show, basically.
