We like to say that our core activity is human data interactions, which includes data visualization and more generally everything that help users understand the data and do something useful with it. At Dataveyes, I share my time between management tasks, running the studio and doing data visualization. Part of the conception team inside Dataveyes, I'm doing user research, data exploration, data storytelling, information architecture and so I was a student when we started Dataveyes, so I've never really worked anywhere else. I was studying data journalism at that time, more broadly, social science, information and communication sciences. And so, yes, I've always been a mathematics lover.

And, yeah, it just happened. I was in a transitioning phase, in a transition phase in my career after I realized that I wasn't as good as a designer as I thought I was and that I liked the idea of designing a company more than designing projects. And just like a joke, we were a designer myself and an architect, a sociologist and an economist walked into a bar. Exactly. Exactly. Just like a joke. And what brought us together was, like, design and numbers, basically, and an interest for qualitative data. So that's how it came together. And we're now a company that has been founded in Milan, in Italy, and we are 40 people between our main office in Milan, where most of the design team is, and New York, where I live, and where we opened a few years ago, a small commercial outpost to work with our American clients.

      "text": "Yes. That's always difficult to pick up one project. None of our project is perfect. So maybe I can take just two short to illustrate the different sides of what we do. The first one I can choose is a project for Leboncoin, Leboncoin. It's the number one platform for sales between private individuals in France, but it's also one of the biggest actors, the biggest actor for classified ads on car markets and real estate in France. And so they have also a lot of professional users, and they asked us to design and to develop the dashboard for their professional accounts. And their initial idea was to give to these professional users some information about their ads and their ads performance. For example, number of views, number of click, so these kind of things. And so we started this project, and when we were doing our user research, we discovered that the real final users, they were not at all interested about this kind of thing. They were not at all interested about this kind of KPI's, because they were salesmen in some small structures, for example, small car dealerships, or they were garage owners, or they were assistants or secretaries in very small real estate offices. And all those people, sometimes they had some very old computers, and they don't have time to follow KPI's. They are not looking to this kind of thing. They don't like reporting, they are not interesting about checking if they are good or not at Leboncoin every day. And they just want to sell. They want to sell their cars, they want to sell their real estate. So the most interesting part of this project was the user research part, the user centric approach, because at the end, we transformed the initial idea of this performance monitoring dashboard into a dashboard dedicated to ads that don't work on Leboncoin, because, in fact, we were working closely with the data science team, and we collaborated with them to be able to identify ads that are less performing than others for the same kind of good. For example, ads that have less views or that have less clicks than other ads for the same kind of flat in the same region, or the same kind of car with the same model and so on. And this was much more interesting for our final users, because an ad that is not seen on Leboncoin, it's a car that may stay in their garage or flat or house that will stay longer. And this is really concrete stuff for them because it's lots of business opportunities. And so when we tested this idea with the final users, they love it. And so the visualization part of this project, it was really, really simple. It was not interesting at all. But I like this project because it illustrates an important part of our job, which is to find the right information inside the data to make something useful and something that as a real use value. And maybe the second project I would like to mention, it's a project for Michelin in France, and it's exactly the opposite, because in this case, the data visualization was really key from the beginning to find what's interesting inside the data set. And in fact, Michelin gave us an anonymized data set with the daily journeys of 50,000 car drivers. Those drivers were equipped with the plugs inside their car, and we get one year of data. And the id for Michelin was, yes, let's do something interesting with that. We don't really know what's interesting inside this data set, but if you try to visualize it, I'm sure you will find something cool with that.",

The idea was the dataset was really, really huge, so it was naturally possible to look at the data first and define what we want to do with that. So we were doing prototypes, data visualization prototypes, my prototypes, with the real data from the beginning of the project. And we have been working two months on the project, and each week we were trying something different, testing a new prototype, a new visualization. And at the end, we managed to deliver something that was functional, because little by little, we came to something interesting. And at the end, the final prototype, it was quite helpful to understand mobility pattern. And Michelin was finding good to discuss with, with local authorities or cities to discuss about mobility pattern. And so this illustrates the other part of what we do, which is using data visualization as a knowledge tool to find interesting patterns, to find some new information and make everyone able to make it their own, not only developers or not only experts. And so, yes, that's the two side of what we do, finding the right information and trying to discover something new with the data, something useful.",

And I'd say all of our projects can be divided into two main families. So communication and experience design projects and more functional work and business oriented tools and solutions. So, like, a few examples of the first family could be all of activities related to reporting. For example, we work extensively with the World Economic Forum, United Nations, World bank, doing static, interactive reporting for them.

Cloud based data science platform for a mortgage data provider. So it's basically based on the idea of like a Python notebook. It's like a solution that helps them sell their data in a cloud based environment. Instead of just shipping a hard drive with their data on, they're providing access in real time to the data and the tools that data scientists need to work with this data so to load different models, play with them. And we have been building this platform for the past three years, we're still improving it, and it's very different from other types of projects because we have a longstanding relationship with the client where our teams are integrated. So our design and engineer team works with their engineering team and we have been working remotely with them for the past three years building this incredibly big platform. That was a heavy lift on the technical side. And of course it includes data visualization that we designed. But data visualization is just like the tip of the iceberg in this case. Or for example, one of our biggest clients is IBM, and we've been working with them for the past four years consulting on like creating Dataviz branding guidelines for them. So we're responsible to write, create, maintain and keep updated this data visualization guidelines for the entire company. So for all of IBM Worldwide, and we are now integrated with their team, working with their designers and engineers in creating both guidelines rules, but also samples, examples, snippets of code and even actual JavaScript visualizations that are used in their libraries. So it's, the range of projects is pretty wide and different.

And yeah, every project has its own component of innovation, because ultimately, if a client ends up working with us, it's because there's a problem that they cannot solve without data visualization, specific expertise, or an expertise in working with large amounts of data, in creating digital experiences that leverage this data. So there's. We're often tasked with problems that couldn't be solved by the client. So I'd say there's a component of innovation and experimentation in every project. And I agree it's valid for most of the projects. Sometimes it doesn't happen. Usually the relationship doesn't work when there is little space for experimentation, because it means that we're not needed to solve the problem. So it becomes a commodity, basically. And so these projects usually either don't happen because if it's something that doesn't require highly trained staff to do it, probably not going to be paid much. And also, if the client doesn't value the expertise of our stuff, probably the relationship is not going to work ultimately. So even for the most business oriented work, we actually do a lot of experimentation, sometimes even more, because it's a deeper level of experimentation, because it's not just on the surface on how you present information, but it has a lot to do with how you solve structural issues in dealing with information. So, like information density and working with interfaces on multiple devices, with visual information, with multiples, like input interfaces and different screen ratios. So, yeah, I think it's a common denominator of our work is the fact that we always have to do something different from the project before.",

So usually I like this kind of relationship with the client because it's nothing client giving order, but it's more a relation where you have to explain him a lot, train him on something.

So data storytelling projects for brands or for organization, who were looking for something attractive, information experience that can be attractive. And then we have been doing less and less communication projects and more and more business oriented tools for big companies who have massive data sets, who have data challenges. They need business tools, they need to work better with that data. And we have been doing more and more tools like that. And nowadays, since I would say one year and half, more and more, we are working with smaller companies. Their core business is a product, most part of the time, that relies on data. And those companies, they already have some designers and some developers to build the product, to build their software, but they do not have any expertise in data visualization or in data design. And they don't know where to find this expertise. They can't hire people with this expertise because there are too few and they need to build their product with us. And so we are working with them. We are joining their team for three months or six months, and we build the product with them. And after that we leave and we train their team at the same time. And this is something new. And maybe this is something interesting, because in my opinion, in the future, any product or any new application software will be dealing with data in one way or another, because it's like the new way. It's not the new way, but it's the way information will be encoded. Maybe the expertise we have, any people working on applications or softwares will need to get this expertise for the future, to be able to deal with our new information overload environment and so on. So maybe this is just the preliminary step for a world where any designer will be a data visualization designer, or at least a human data interaction designer. And maybe we are just at the beginning and we are making the transition. But yeah, this is quite interesting to see that from communication to business tools, to building a product with people.",

      "text": "Yeah, I think it's also like the future will probably be shaped around two of the key components I think agencies have is that, that they integrate a multidisciplinary team, often so people that have been working together for a while, but that have different expertise, but know how to combine these expertise and also the exposure to multiple projects, that's something our clients value a lot, because you can start a data visualization team in your company, but it will most likely be focused on one specific task or a set of tasks. And sometimes bringing in someone who has seen different types of visualization, who has dealt with that specific situation, or with similar, but slightly different situations that provide different challenges can bring an outside perspective that it's very useful for the company. What we've seen during our evolution is that initially we were hired for anything that had to do with data visualization. As Caroline said, like a lot of storytelling projects, one off visualizations, the single report, a single image or a poster, or a single interactive visualization. More and more I see that this like part of work now is being developed internally within organizations, and what's left is the very high end stuff. So the very complex problems that need people who have been working on similar challenges for many years and need integrated teams with different skills that range from data scientists to the experience designer, the front end developer developer that all have an experience with data, but also, interestingly, a lot of very basic work that now it's done manually, that needs to be automated in some way, that needs to scale. And this requires sometimes the expertise of someone from the outside who can help guide the process of scaling. If you hire one designer, this designer can output ten data visualizations a day. But what if you need 10,000 a day? How can you set up a system that allows you to replicate a very simple job at scale? And I think that's also an aspect. So the very low and the very high end of the spectrum remains. Probably what's in the middle will be developed internally by organizations. And to create the teams that develop this work, you need training. And this is also something that is growing for us. We do a lot of training of internal resources. We help organizations hire people and set up teams, so we do interviews for them. We help them pick the right people, form the right teams who will ultimately end up working with us.

Even the most complex engineering tasks, they rarely involve more than four or five engineers, because over that, it becomes unmanageable.

So, like, for example, we have a weekly dataviz recap and a weekly experience design recap, a weekly software like front end recap, which means that everyone that's interested, not necessarily the people that have a label attached to their name, deals with experience design, but, like, everyone who's working on a project that involves experience design in the company joins. And the idea is that each person has five minutes to share what they're working on and the challenges they're facing. So there's a roundtable on how that challenge could be solved so that people learn about other projects in the firm and chime in on how they would approach the problem. So you get the advantage of having many experts around the table, but then you can keep a smaller team to run the single project. Then we also have, like, we offer lunch one day, like, every Thursday. We have this, like, learning burgers. Now, it's not not just burgers anymore. They get what they want. We're not forcing the burgers. It started with burgers, but now it's learning with what you want to order and roll your tongue. The team has a program as a schedule, and each one in the team comes up with a topic they want to talk about to the entire company, and they just give a lesson about something that they had to study for a project or something they know. So, for example, our data scientists talk about a specific topic that might be of interest for designers working with machine learning tools, or like, creating interfaces for artificial intelligence.

Yeah, we feel that it's really complicated to find people who have already worked in the field of data visualization, who are already trained, who know how to do data visualization inside a studio. And so you need to train people a lot. When we are hiring people, designers or developers, they don't really know data visualization.

And in my opinion, this is really a barrier to entry for other kind of company. For example, in France we see lots of consultancy firms, big firms, consulting big firms who are hiring developers, data scientists, and who are also hiring designers. And they just cannot do what we are doing because they don't know how to make those people work together. And so they have data scientists, they have user experience designers, but they can't do the kind of projects we are doing. And yes, this is something really specific and very hard to explain how you make those talented people work together. Because at, at the beginning, designers that are doing data visualization in database team, they know how to cut, they are also developers and at the same time developers inside our team, they are also designers, or part of their brain is also a designer brain and they are talented people. And also they have a mix of skill that is quite unique, each of them, and which is really difficult to replicate or to train. It will be really hard for me to explain how we make the team work together at that. It's something a bit magic, but that's.",

And also, I think, in general, European work culture helps us because, I mean, we have people in our team that have been with us for seven years, eight years, and, like, in a fast moving market, like the United States, for example, it's hard to find people that want to focus for a good part of their career on one company. And this creates, like, helps creating a culture. So now we have people that have been working on accurate projects for many years that know our methodology inside out, and this multiplies the opportunity to train people on how we work. And I, and I think it's an advantage of how we're culturally used to work, as opposed to changing job every year, moving from tech company to tech company, that clearly makes it harder to create this connection between different disciplines and create a culture that is not.

That's where when I'm a designer and I like solving these challenges, but definitely I don't like the actual design task on a project. I'm fascinated by product companies, but I'm definitely not fascinated by Silicon Valley culture. So, like, I know I would love to work on a product, but not in the stereotypical VC funded way where you have to run to own the market and if you don't do it, you're done. Because I feel there is space for digital products, companies that aim not at conquering a huge market and make billions, but that can create sustainable businesses. But like our company, like lifestyle businesses, something I will never become a billionaire with. Accurate. And that's not the point. There's no way this could happen because it can only scale with the amount of hours people can dedicate to the world. So there is no magical trick. And I think this idea can be applied. There are many successful product companies that are not VC backed or not entirely VC backed that are, I think, a good opportunity for the future. And I'd like to explore, like how you can create a software or a digital product without the logic of scaling for the sake of it, because you need to provide an economical return to who put money in your venture.
