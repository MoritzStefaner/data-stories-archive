But it's just because when I would present my work, people would kind of hold my work to kind of the rigorous standards of data vision, like more traditional data visualization or information design. And I felt like there were a lot of ways that I used data that didn't really seem to, that sort of meant that my work didn't really fall specifically into those two categories. So I think there needs to be another, there needs to be something called data illustration, where you're using data just in, possibly in a way to communicate a more subjective emotion, or you use data to fulfill a design brief where the data is secondary to another more important message. I'm just trying to find a way of explaining how I, as a graphic designer, like to use data to sort of arrive at a design outcome.

I think honestly, I mean, I have had huge debates about this thing on functional aesthetics and all this stuff and whether the visualization community, if we can really define one, is too critical or if it's too hard to enter into this world and so on. And from the one end, I fully agree that there is a tendency to overly criticized works. But at the same time, I think what we have here, it's a nice story about, because of this criticism, you've been pushed to define your work in a different way and maybe come up with a label that is going to be useful for some other people. And I really like the fact that you are not pretending to frame your work into the same frame other people use. And just say from the very beginning, look, what I'm doing here, it's something I call differently. So if you want to look at my work, you have to put another pair of glasses.

I think in a way, I wouldn't like to have a situation where there's no criticism because criticism, even if it can be painful from time to time, it also helps developing this kind of new things.

Album artwork that I've done because I was dealing with text that dealt with rainbows and the spectrum of light and diamonds and mountains and so diamonds and rainbows and circles and prisms and those were the shapes I was using in the ideas that I was coming up with. So, and then I'll start to sketch on paper with pencil how I think that data could be represented. And then when I'm happy with some pencil sketches, I'll start working them up in illustrator.

And at the same time, they felt the last 10% or so, you know, cannot be done by a machine, but have to be solved by hand. So they developed that tool that would first do an automatic layout, and then all the problematic rest would be solved with human thinking. And I think that's a strong approach. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

So that reminded me also of how Steph works. So she went through a very personal text and analyzed it by hand. And then she made paper based diagrams, but out of cardboard, and glued them together and made these little sculptures, and then took, again, photos of that and made a book out of that. So that's sort of a twisted way to come to a data representation. But the results, you know, they have this really this warm and nice feel and this unique style.
