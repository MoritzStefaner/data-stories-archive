Hey everyone, welcome to a new episode of Data stories. Today is only a episode without Moritz. Moritz is on vacation. Hey Moritz, you'll enjoy listening to this one. And before I introduce our special guest for today, I want to briefly mention our Patreon crowdfunding initiative. So what we are trying to do in the show is to go ads free and you can support the show by going on Patreon. And this is patreon.com Datastories and you can pledge some amount that will be. So the way Patreon works is that you can decide to offer to us a certain little amount of money in the order of two, three, four or $5. And we charge you this amount every time we publish an episode. It's a very neat system and you can sign up and if you don't like it, you can also just stop it anytime. And basically for the price of a latte or coffee every two weeks. You support the show. So if you are interested, and you are interested, if you like our show and you're interested in supporting us, just go to patreon.com Datastories and you'll find all the information about why we are doing this and how it works. So now let me start with our guest for today. So for today we are talking about a very nice project that has been recently published in a paper at the CHI conference, the main human computer interaction conference. And the project is called C\u2019est la vis and it's a very important topic. It's about visualization literacy, how to basically teach people how to read and also make visualization. But in this particular case, what is really nice is that the authors have been working on how to teach visualization at the elementary school level to kids. So that's very nice. And on the show I have two of the authors of the paper. We have Basak Alper and Nathalie Riche.",

I've been kind of thinking about data and how complex data can be visualized, and I've been just, I think, fascinated by the way you can help people explore their data and just watching people discover new things they didn't know about their data. So my PhD was in computer science, and I was in the Aviz lab in, in. I was working with social scientists there. I also did part of my PhD in Australia, which is really cool experience to have two PhDs, I guess. But then when I started at Microsoft research, I started working with more end users, I guess, to just the regular people, rather than researchers in neuroscience or social science. And so naturally, my interest kind of went around storytelling, the way you could communicate with data. So that's mostly what I'm doing these days. And that naturally led to how do you teach people to better read and understand visualization and also create them?",

Yes, I'm a Fulbright scholar and upon completing my PhD, I had to go back to Turkey and I started a postdoc there at the user interfaces lab. And we got a grant to develop educational tools for tablet devices because education Ministry of Education was distributing free tablets to schools, but they didn't know what to do with them. So being a visualization researcher, I started to think about visualization related topics and I started to look at textbooks. I gathered a bunch of textbooks and noticed that they are very, very rich in visual representation of data, even in very early grades, like even in pre k. And children start to learn about formal visualizations such as histograms and bar charts as early as third grade. Then Nathalie and I started to talk about what role visualizations play in early education and how much kids learn about formal visualizations, how they are taught about visualizations and what is the level of expected visualization literacy at this level.

One part is that Basak started her postdoc there and we stayed very close after our internship. I really enjoy working with her and so we kept conversation going there. One other kind of event is that I had kids starting preschool, so I actually was looking at blocks and having them make bar chart with blocks in some ways. And I guess the last set of events is that, you know, there were like this more and more infographics every day in the news. And I guess I was just annoyed by the amount of incorrect charts out there. So all of these together kind of made that project very compelling at the time.

Although we observed they are very, very similar, we didn't want to bring another kind of confound in the study. But informally, I started to talk to teachers and we realized visualizations play a key role. You know, they have to explain things with visuals all the time and they have to teach visualizations. But there is, how should I say, you know, but in terms of using, making use of interactive tools, they don't do anything novel with the interactivity. They still use, you know, whatever there was ten years ago, still relying on static images and still kind of explaining one visual representation and then later in months later introducing another complexity level of visualization. Things progress very gradually. They don't make use of interactivity. We noticed these discrepancies very early on, and C\u2019est la vis started to shape.",

There is a, you know, a very formal breakdown in the paper, which is too many details to go through here, but there is a rich variety. Some of the visualizations are, you know, like, for instance, bar charts are the most common formal visualization that we encounter in elementary schools.

And basically you can access either the exercise that, that we've created online, so you can share the URL, in fact, with other people. And you can also, if you access the authoring version, then you can create your own series of exercises. Right. With your styles and whatever kind of sequence you want.

We have a lot of operators looking at complicated dashboards and we want to use more abstract visualizations, say like parallel lines. But our operators are not familiar with that visualization, so we can use a similar approach. Hey, you know, this is how you look at bunch of bar charts and this is how they map to the parallel lines. Visualization, it can be used as a educational training tool. The same approach can be used for training for complicated visualizations. That's one, you know, area that I want to explore in the future. And I'm sure Natalie has others too.",

And I think that I want to just pursue that in that age range. I think that's as important as learning to read and count is just kind of reflect that what you can read or, you know, the sort of material you can access actually might just be incorrect or incomplete.",

I think that's, that's an amazing opportunity to teach an important skill very early on and I think that there is a lot to discover there. We just don't know exactly how to teach kids to do this properly. And. Yeah, it's super, super fascinating. Well, okay. Thanks so much for coming on the show. That's, congratulations for this beautiful project and thanks for moving this steps towards, yeah. Learning more about how to teach visualization to kids. I hope there will be more work in this direction in the future. Actually, we had a couple of episodes in the past that are related to this topic. We had one whole episode on visualization literacy in general, and we also had on episode 87, we had a whole show and a book called these Kids. So if you didn't listen to it, it's a very nice episode on a little book that has been designed to teach visualization to kids. So thanks so much, Basak and Nathalie, for coming on the show.",
