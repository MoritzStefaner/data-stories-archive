# Data Stories Archive

This is the data and code behind the [Data Stories Podcast Archive](https://archive.datastori.es).

It is based on automatic audio transcriptions of the 170 episodes we recorded since February 2012. 

We used <https://www.assemblyai.com/> to transcribe the audio files. 

The automatic transcription works very well for known English words, but has its limitations for proper names or domain specific terms. 
So we used custom word replacement lists to fix some of the most apparent misspellings. 

Another nice feature of the automatic transcription is that each utterance (in fact, every simgle work) is exactly timestamped, so we can jump to arbitrary audio snippets based on e.g. a text search
